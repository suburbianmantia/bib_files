	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease characterized by T-lymphocyte activation and lymphocyte migration into involved organs, usually the lungs. The amounts of a number of biochemical markers, such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity, increase in the serum of patients with sarcoidosis. Chitotriosidase is an enzyme secreted by activated macrophages able to catalyze the hydrolysis of both chitin and chitin-like substrates. Chitotriosidase is involved in defense against, and in degradation of chitin-containing pathogens such as fungi, nematodes, and insects.
METHODS: Forty-three patients affected by chronic sarcoidosis, in active (23 patients) or inactive (20 patients) phase, were studied. Serum levels of chitotriosidase and ACE activity were evaluated and compared with those of 32 healthy subjects. Serum chitotriosidase concentration and ACE activity were also correlated with radiographic stage of disease.
RESULTS: Individuals with chronic sarcoidosis have higher serum chitotriosidase concentrations and ACE activity than those of normal subjects. Sarcoidosis patients in the active phase of the disease had significantly higher chitotriosidase and ACE levels than those in the inactive phase. In contrast to serum ACE activity, a significant relationship between serum levels of chitotriosidase and the four radiographic stages of the disease was observed.
CONCLUSION: Although the data need to be validated by further investigation, the observations made in this study seem to indicate that serum chitotriosidase concentrations may be a useful marker for monitoring sarcoidosis disease activity and prognosis.},

	abstract = {Background
Chitinolytic enzymes play important roles in the pathophysiology of allergic airway responses in mouse models of asthma. Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) and chitotriosidase (CHIT1) have chitinolytic activity, but relatively little is known about their expression in human asthma.

Objective
To determine the expression and activity of AMCase and CHIT1 in health, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (disease control), taking account of the null 24bp duplication in the CHIT1 gene.

Methods
We measured chitinase activity in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at multiple pH’s using a synthetic chitin substrate. We also determined AMCase and CHIT1 gene expression in epithelial brushings and BAL macrophages by real time RT-PCR. Paired DNA samples were genotyped for the CHIT1 duplication.

Results
In all subgroups, the pH profile of chitinase activity in BAL matched that of chitotriosidase, not AMCase, and chitinase activity was absent in subjects genetically deficient in active chitotriosidase. Although AMCase protein was detectable in lavage, AMCase transcripts in macrophages were consistent with an isoform lacking enzymatic activity. Median chitinase activity in BAL tended to be lower than normal in asthma, but was increased 7-fold in COPD, where CHIT1 gene expression in macrophages was increased.

Conclusions
Chitinase activity in the lung is the result of CHIT1 activity. Although AMCase protein is detectable in the lung, our data indicates that it is inactive. Chitinase activity is not increased in asthma and in fact tends to be decreased. The high levels of chitinase activity in COPD result from upregulation of CHIT1 gene expression, especially in macrophages.},

	abstract = {Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology. The unpredictable clinical course of the disease has prompted research into biomarkers useful for predicting outcome. Among the potential markers of sarcoidosis, a recently proposed indicator was chitotriosidase, a chitinase produced by activated macrophages. Chitotriosidase is involved in the defense against pathogens containing chitin. Increased concentrations of chitotriosidase have been observed in a number of lysosomal storage diseases including Gaucher disease and more recently also in sarcoidosis. In 2004, significantly higher serum chitotriosidase activity was reported for the first time in sarcoidosis patients with respect to controls (p {\textless} 0.01); a similar increase was subsequently observed in bronchoalveolar lavage of these patients. In 2007, an increase in enzyme activity was described in juvenile sarcoidosis. Chitotriosidase activity was found to be correlated with angiotensin-converting enzyme levels in serum, radiological stages and quantitative high-resonance CT score for sarcoidosis, suggesting that this enzyme could be a potential marker of disease severity worthy of further study. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this marker, further analysis was done in other granulomatous and diffuse lung diseases. Here, we review the principal literature and the recent evidence of chitotriosidase as a possible marker of sarcoidosis.},

	abstract = {Autophagy involves the lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic contents for regeneration of anabolic substrates during nutritional or inflammatory stress. Its initiation occurs rapidly after inactivation of the protein kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (or mechanistic target of rapamycin), leading to dephosphorylation of Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) and autophagosome formation. Recent studies indicate that mTOR can, in parallel, regulate the activity of stress transcription factors, including signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1). The current study addresses the role of STAT1 as a transcriptional suppressor of autophagy genes and autophagic activity. We show that STAT1-deficient human fibrosarcoma cells exhibited enhanced autophagic flux as well as its induction by pharmacological inhibition of mTOR. Consistent with enhanced autophagy initiation, ULK1 mRNA and protein levels were increased in STAT1-deficient cells. By chromatin immunoprecipitation, STAT1 bound a putative regulatory sequence in the ULK1 5′-flanking region, the mutation of which increased ULK1 promoter activity, and rendered it unresponsive to mTOR inhibition. Consistent with an anti-apoptotic effect of autophagy, rapamycin-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity were blocked in STAT1-deficient cells but restored in cells simultaneously exposed to the autophagy inhibitor ammonium chloride. In vivo, skeletal muscle ULK1 mRNA and protein levels as well as autophagic flux were significantly enhanced in STAT1-deficient mice. These results demonstrate a novel mechanism by which STAT1 negatively regulates ULK1 expression and autophagy.},

Since the discovery of mTOR, extensive studies have intricately detailed the molecular mechanisms by which mTORC1 is regulated.

Moreover, Rab1A is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), which is correlated with elevated mTORC1 signaling, tumor invasion, progression, and poor prognosis.

	abstract = {Tumour cells can use strategies that make them resistant to nutrient deprivation to outcompete their neighbours. A key integrator of the cell's responses to starvation and other stresses is amino-acid-dependent mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Activation of mTORC1 on late endosomes and lysosomes is facilitated by amino-acid transporters within the solute-linked carrier 36 (SLC36) and SLC38 families. Here, we analyse the functions of SLC36 family member, SLC36A4, otherwise known as proton-assisted amino-acid transporter 4 (PAT4), in colorectal cancer. We show that independent of other major pathological factors, high PAT4 expression is associated with reduced relapse-free survival after colorectal cancer surgery. Consistent with this, PAT4 promotes HCT116 human colorectal cancer cell proliferation in culture and tumour growth in xenograft models. Inducible knockdown in HCT116 cells reveals that PAT4 regulates a form of mTORC1 with two distinct properties: first, it preferentially targets eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), and second, it is resistant to rapamycin treatment. Furthermore, in HCT116 cells two non-essential amino acids, glutamine and serine, which are often rapidly metabolised by tumour cells, regulate rapamycin-resistant mTORC1 in a PAT4-dependent manner. Overexpressed PAT4 is also able to promote rapamycin resistance in human embryonic kidney-293 cells. PAT4 is predominantly associated with the Golgi apparatus in a range of cell types, and in situ proximity ligation analysis shows that PAT4 interacts with both mTORC1 and its regulator Rab1A on the Golgi. These findings, together with other studies, suggest that differentially localised intracellular amino-acid transporters contribute to the activation of alternate forms of mTORC1. Furthermore, our data predict that colorectal cancer cells with high PAT4 expression will be more resistant to depletion of serine and glutamine, allowing them to survive and outgrow neighbouring normal and tumorigenic cells, and potentially providing a new route for pharmacological intervention.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease with a variable clinical presentation and disease course. There is still no reliable biomarker available, which assists in the diagnosis or prediction of the clinical course. According to a murine model, the expression level of the metabolic checkpoint kinase mechanistic target of Rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in granulomas of sarcoidosis patients may be used as a clinical biomarker.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 58 patients with histologically confirmed sarcoidosis. Immunohistochemical staining of granulomas from tissue samples was evaluated for the expression of activated mTORC1 signaling, including phosphorylated mTOR, its downstream effectors S6K1, 4EBP1 and the proliferation marker Ki-67. Patients were categorized according to different clinical phenotypes, serum biomarkers, and immunomodulatory therapy.
RESULTS: All patients showed activated mTORC1 signaling in granulomas, which correlated with its downstream effectors S6K1 and 4EBP1 but was not related to Ki-67 expression. The mTORC1 activity revealed an association neither to disease severity nor the necessity of treatment; however, p-mTOR inversely correlated with cumulative corticosteroid dosage.
CONCLUSION: Our data confirm activation of the mTORC1 pathway in sarcoidosis, supporting the hypothesis that mTOR is a significant driver in granuloma formation. However, we could not find a relationship between the degree of mTOR activation and disease severity or the need for therapy.},

	abstract = {Human cartilage glycoprotein 39 (HC gp-39) has been described as a major secreted product of cultured articular chondrocytes, synovial fibroblasts, and the osteosarcoma line MG63. However, its expression in these cells types has not been directly linked to corresponding cell types in vivo. In this report, expression of HC gp-39 is demonstrated from peripheral blood-derived macrophages in association with their differentiation from monocytes to macrophages. Consistent with macrophage specificity, HC gp-39 expression is also induced upon selective stimulation of the pluripotent promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 toward the monocyte/macrophage lineage with vitamin D3 or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), while treatments stimulating granulocyte and eosinophilic pathways do not induce expression. Furthermore, HC gp-39 expression levels correlate with the degree of morphological differentiation induced by PMA and vitamin D3 treatments. PMA-induced mRNA expression occurs by 36 h and is a secondary transcriptional response since its synthesis is inhibited by cycloheximide. Apparently, HC gp-39 expression is tied to later events in the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages. The in vivo significance of these results is validated by the in situ detection of HC gp-39 mRNA in inflammatory macrophages associated with rheumatoid synovium. Thus, macrophages appear to be an important source of HC gp-39, which has been shown to be present at elevated levels in the blood and synovium of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The implications of this extend well beyond the previously restricted observations in cell types associated with the joint and suggest a potential involvement of macrophage-derived HC gp-39 in other aspects of inflammation, tissue remodeling, and host defense.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.rmed.2004.09.016},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: YKL-40, a growth factor for fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells, is secreted by macrophages and neutrophils. Elevated serum YKL-40 is found in patients with diseases characterized by inflammation, tissue remodelling and ongoing fibrosis. The aim was to evaluate whether macrophages and giant cells in the granulomatous sarcoid lesions of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis produce YKL-40 and to determine whether serum YKL-40 in these patients were associated with disease activity.
METHODS: Serum YKL-40 was determined by radioimmunoassay in 27 patients with a histological diagnosis of pulmonal sarcoidosis. Immunohistochemical staining for YKL-40 antigen was performed in five biopsies with pulmonary sarcoid lesions. Serum YKL-40 was likewise measured in 173 healthy age-matched control subjects.
RESULTS: Mononuclear cells/macrophages and giant cells in pulmonary sarcoid granulomas expressed YKL-40 protein. Serum YKL-40 was higher in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis compared to controls (P{\textless}0.001) and 63\% had elevated serum YKL-40. There was a positive correlation between serum YKL-40 and serum angiotensin converting enzyme (rho=0.55, P=0.0053). Patients with serum YKL-40{\textgreater}median value in the patient group had lower carbon monoxide diffusion capacity corrected for alveolar volume (DLCO/VA) than patients with serum YKL-40 the median value (P=0.015).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum YKL-40 may be a novel biomarker of sarcoid disease activity and ongoing fibrosis in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis.},

The anergic state, which results from various immune defects, contrasts with the inflammatory formation of granulomas. Sarcoidosis patients may be at risk for opportunistic infections (OIs) and a substantial number of cases have been reported, even in untreated sarcoidosis. It is not clear how OIs in patients with sarcoidosis are different from other groups at risk. In this review, we discuss the most common OIs: mycobacterial infection (including tuberculosis), cryptococcosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and aspergillosis. Unlike peripheral lymphocytopenia, corticosteroids are a major risk factor for OIs but the occurrence of Ols in untreated patients suggests more complex predisposing mechanisms. Opportunistic infections presenting with extrapulmonary features are often misdiagnosed as new localizations of sarcoidosis. Aspergillomas mostly develop on fibrocystic lungs. Overall, physicians should be aware of the possible occurrence of OIs during sarcoidosis, even in untreated patients.},

Disparities in outcomes exist by race, ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic groups, with African Americans having disproportionately more severe disease. Mortality rates are highest in African Americans, but may be increasing in white individuals. The health care burden of sarcoidosis is defined not only by its somatic manifestations, but is also greatly impacted by psychosocial, economic, and comorbid conditions associated with this disease. Fatigue, depression, cognitive dysfunction, treatment side effects, and pain syndromes are highly prevalent in this population and contribute to poor outcomes. The direct and indirect economic costs to patients and society are likely also substantial, although not well defined. We recommend leveraging existing and future technology and infrastructure to more accurately define and monitor the overall total sarcoidosis-attributable health care burden and patient outcomes in the United States.},

Since its recognition in the late 19th century, sarcoidosis has been thought of as a disease of unknown cause. Over the past 20 years, this paradigm has been shifting, more rapidly in the past 10 years. Epidemiologic studies, bolstered by case reports, have provided evidence of causal associations between occupational exposure to specific agents and sarcoidosis. Pathogenesis has been more clearly defined, including the role of gene-exposure interactions. The use of in vitro lymphocyte proliferation testing to detect sensitization to inorganic antigens is being examined in patients with sarcoidosis. These antigens include silica and certain metals. Results of studies to date show differences in immunoreactivity of occupationally exposed sarcoidosis cases compared with control cases, suggesting that lymphocyte proliferation testing may prove useful in diagnosing work-related disease. This review discusses recently published findings regarding associations between occupational exposure to silica and silicates, World Trade Center dust, and metals and risk for sarcoidosis, as well as advances in the development of diagnostic tools. Not all cases of sarcoidosis have an identified cause, but some do. Where the cause is occupational, its recognition is critical to enable effective treatment through removal of the affected worker from exposure and to inform intervention aimed at primary prevention.},

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were treated by digestion-filtration and analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. The chemical composition of inorganic particles was determined by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Dust exposure was also assessed by a specific questionnaire. Eight sarcoidosis patients and five healthy volunteers had a high dust load in their BAL. No significant difference was observed between the overall inorganic particle load of each group while a significant higher load for steel was observed in sarcoidosis patients (p=0.029). Moreover, the building activity sub-score was significantly higher in sarcoidosis patients (p=0.018). These results suggest that building work could be a risk factor for sarcoidosis which could be considered at least in some cases as a granulomatosis caused by airborne inorganic dust. The questionnaire should be validated in larger studies. (Sarcoidosis Vasc Diffuse Lung Dis 2018; 35: 327-332)},

	abstract = {Background: The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is not standardized but is based on three major criteria: a compatible clinical presentation, finding nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation in one or more tissue samples, and the exclusion of alternative causes of granulomatous disease. There are no universally accepted measures to determine if each diagnostic criterion has been satisfied; therefore, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is never fully secure., Methods: Systematic reviews and, when appropriate, meta-analyses were performed to summarize the best available evidence. The evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. Recommendations for or against various diagnostic tests were formulated and graded after the expert panel weighed desirable and undesirable consequences, certainty of estimates, feasibility, and acceptability., Results: The clinical presentation, histopathology, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses were summarized. On the basis of the available evidence, the expert committee made 1 strong recommendation for baseline serum calcium testing, 13 conditional recommendations, and 1 best practice statement. All evidence was very low quality., Conclusions: The panel used systematic reviews of the evidence to inform clinical recommendations in favor of or against various diagnostic tests in patients with suspected or known sarcoidosis. The evidence and recommendations should be revisited as new evidence becomes available.},

	abstract = {Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease with tremendous heterogeneity in disease manifestations, severity, and clinical course that varies among different ethnic and racial groups. To better understand this disease and to improve the outcomes of patients, a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop was convened to assess the current state of knowledge, gaps, and research needs across the clinical, genetic, environmental, and immunologic arenas. We also explored to what extent the interplay of the genetic, environmental, and immunologic factors could explain the different phenotypes and outcomes of patients with sarcoidosis, including the chronic phenotypes that have the greatest healthcare burden. The potential use of current genetic, epigenetic, and immunologic tools along with study approaches that integrate environmental exposures and precise clinical phenotyping were also explored. Finally, we made expert panel–based consensus recommendations for research approaches and priorities to improve our understanding of the effect of these factors on the health outcomes in sarcoidosis.},

	abstract = {This British Thoracic Society (BTS) Clinical Statement addresses the diagnosis, evaluation and management of pulmonary sarcoidosis, with each section summarised with key clinical practice points. In an era in which medical practice is increasingly determined by evidence-based guidelines, it must be acknowledged from the outset that current evidence in sarcoidosis, especially with regard to treatment, is weak. Thus, a number of the conclusions in this Statement are based on expert opinion and accumulated clinical experience.

The diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis is often challenging, with ongoing evolution in clinician views on the need for a tissue diagnosis. Historically, a biopsy diagnosis was considered mandatory and we provide guidance on when to offer bronchoscopy and which bronchoscopic procedure to perform. We also stress that decisions made by individual patients to decline bronchoscopy, when there is a highly probable but not definite clinical diagnosis, should be supported in most cases, with careful subsequent monitoring. The document includes sections on the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis and pulmonary hypertension as either disorder may present to respiratory physicians as ‘symptomatic pulmonary sarcoidosis’.

Traditional treatment algorithms and their reported application in the medical literature tend to be based on a ‘one size fits all’ approach and this has often led to over-treatment and major steroid-related comorbidity. However, a great many patients do not need to be treated: the broad indications for initiating therapy are (1) a high risk of mortality or disability due to major organ involvement; and (2) unacceptable loss of quality of life. In this statement, we focus on the management of pulmonary disease; the management of concurrent cardiac sarcoidosis or pulmonary hypertension requires referral to expert subspecialist teams.

Key pulmonary management considerations are discussed in this Statement. While higher dose treatment regimens may be required in high-risk disease, a highly flexible patient-centred approach is …},

	abstract = {PALB2 (partner and localizer of BRCA2), as indicated by its name, is a BRCA2-interacting protein that plays an important role in homologous recombination (HR) and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. While pathogenic variants of PALB2 have been well proven to confer an increased risk of breast cancer, data on its involvement in prostate cancer (PrC) have not been clearly demonstrated. We investigated, using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS), a 59-year-old Caucasian man who developed synchronous breast and prostate cancers. This genetic investigation allowed to identify an intragenic germline heterozygous duplication in PALB2, implicating intronic repetitive sequences spanning exon 11. This variant was confirmed by multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA), and genomic breakpoints have been identified and characterized at the nucleotide level (c.3114-811\_3202-1756dup) using an approach based on walking PCR, long range PCR, and Sanger sequencing. RT-PCR using mRNA extracted from lymphocytes and followed by Sanger sequencing revealed a tandem duplication r.3114\_3201dup; p.(Gly1068Glufs * 14). This duplication results in the synthesis of a truncated, and most-likely, non-functional protein. These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum of PALB2 variants and may improve the yield of genetic diagnoses in this field.},

Germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1 are found in about 7-10\% of all familial breast cancers and 10\% of ovarian cancers. Alu elements are the most abundant mobile DNA element in the human genome and are known to affect the human genome by different mechanisms leading to human disease. We report here the detection, by next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis coupled with a suitable bioinformatics pipeline, of an AluYb8 element in exon 14 of the BRCA1 gene in a family with HBOC history first classified as BRCA-negative by Sanger sequencing and first NGS analysis. The c.4475\_c.4476insAluYb8 mutation impacts splicing and induces the skipping of exon 14. As a result, the produced mRNA contains a premature stop, leading to the production of a short and likely non-functional protein (pAla1453Glyfs*10). Overall, our study allowed us to identify a novel pathogenic variant in BRCA1 and showed the importance of bioinformatics tool improvement and versioning.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Linking independent sources of data describing the same individuals enable innovative epidemiological and health studies but require a robust record linkage approach. We describe a hybrid record linkage process to link databases from two independent ongoing French national studies, GEMO (Genetic Modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2), which focuses on the identification of genetic factors modifying cancer risk of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, and GENEPSO (prospective cohort of BRCAx mutation carriers), which focuses on environmental and lifestyle risk factors.
METHODS: To identify as many as possible of the individuals participating in the two studies but not registered by a shared identifier, we combined probabilistic record linkage (PRL) and supervised machine learning (ML). This approach (named "PRL + ML") combined together the candidate matches identified by both approaches. We built the ML model using the gold standard on a first version of the two databases as a training dataset. This gold standard was obtained from PRL-derived matches verified by an exhaustive manual review. Results The Random Forest (RF) algorithm showed a highest recall (0.985) among six widely used ML algorithms: RF, Bagged trees, AdaBoost, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network. Therefore, RF was selected to build the ML model since our goal was to identify the maximum number of true matches. Our combined linkage PRL + ML showed a higher recall (range 0.988-0.992) than either PRL (range 0.916-0.991) or ML (0.981) alone. It identified 1995 individuals participating in both GEMO (6375 participants) and GENEPSO (4925 participants).
CONCLUSIONS: Our hybrid linkage process represents an efficient tool for linking GEMO and GENEPSO. It may be generalizable to other epidemiological studies involving other databases and registries.},

	abstract = {Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare syndrome characterized by the co-occurrence of primary hyperparathyroidism, duodenopancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) and/or pituitary adenomas. MEN1 can predispose patients to other endocrine and non-endocrine tumours, such as cutaneous tumours, central nervous system tumours and breast cancer. Endocrine tumours in patients with MEN1 differ from sporadic tumours in that they have a younger age at onset, present as multiple tumours in the same organ and have a different clinical course. Therefore, patients with overt MEN1 and those who carry a MEN1 mutation should be offered tailored biochemical and imaging screening to detect tumours and evaluate their progression over time. Fortunately, over the past 10 years, knowledge about the clinical phenotype of these tumours has markedly progressed, thanks to the implementation of national registries, particularly in France and the Netherlands. This Review provides an update on the clinical management of MEN1-related tumours. Epidemiology, the clinical picture, diagnostic work-up and the main lines of treatment for MEN1-related tumours are summarized. Controversial therapeutic aspects and issues that still need to be addressed are also discussed. Moreover, special attention is given to MEN1 manifestations in children and adolescents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple telangiectases and caused by germline disease-causing variants in the ENG (HHT1), ACVRL1 (HHT2) and, to a lesser extent MADH4 and GDF2, which encode proteins involved in the TGF-β/BMP9 signaling pathway. Common visceral complications of HHT are caused by pulmonary, cerebral, or hepatic arteriovenous malformations (HAVMs). There is large intrafamilial variability in the severity of visceral involvement, suggesting a role for modifier genes. The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential role of ENG, ACVRL1, and of other candidate genes belonging to the same biological pathway in the development of HAVMs.
METHODS: We selected 354 patients from the French HHT patient database who had one disease causing variant in either ENG or ACVRL1 and who underwent hepatic exploration. We first compared the distribution of the different types of variants with the occurrence of HAVMs. Then, we genotyped 51 Tag-SNPs from the Hap Map database located in 8 genes that encode proteins belonging to the TGF-β/BMP9 pathway (ACVRL1, ENG, GDF2, MADH4, SMAD1, SMAD5, TGFB1, TGFBR1), as well as in two additional candidate genes (PTPN14 and ADAM17). We addressed the question of a possible genetic association with the occurrence of HAVMs.
RESULTS: The proportion of patients with germline ACVRL1 variants and the proportion of women were significantly higher in HHT patients with HAVMs. In the HHT2 group, HAVMs were more frequent in patients with truncating variants. Six SNPs (3 in ACVRL1, 1 in ENG, 1 in SMAD5, and 1 in ADAM17) were significantly associated with HAVMs. After correction for multiple testing, only one remained significantly associated (rs2277383).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large association study, we confirmed the strong relationship between ACVRL1 and the development of HAVMs. Common polymorphisms of ACVRL1 may also play a role in the development of HAVMs, as a modifying factor, independently of the disease-causing variants.},

These regions were explored by combining association analysis with in silico genomic feature annotations. We defined 205 independent risk-associated signals with the set of credible causal variants in each one. In parallel, we used a Bayesian approach (PAINTOR) that combines genetic association, linkage disequilibrium and enriched genomic features to determine variants with high posterior probabilities of being causal. Potentially causal variants were significantly over-represented in active gene regulatory regions and transcription factor binding sites. We applied our INQUSIT pipeline for prioritizing genes as targets of those potentially causal variants, using gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci), chromatin interaction and functional annotations. Known cancer drivers, transcription factors and genes in the developmental, apoptosis, immune system and DNA integrity checkpoint gene ontology pathways were over-represented among the highest-confidence target genes.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a common disease partially caused by genetic risk factors. Germline pathogenic variants in DNA repair genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, and CHEK2 are associated with breast cancer risk. FANCM, which encodes for a DNA translocase, has been proposed as a breast cancer predisposition gene, with greater effects for the ER-negative and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. We tested the three recurrent protein-truncating variants FANCM:p.Arg658*, p.Gln1701*, and p.Arg1931* for association with breast cancer risk in 67,112 cases, 53,766 controls, and 26,662 carriers of pathogenic variants of BRCA1 or BRCA2. These three variants were also studied functionally by measuring survival and chromosome fragility in FANCM -/- patient-derived immortalized fibroblasts treated with diepoxybutane or olaparib. We observed that FANCM:p.Arg658* was associated with increased risk of ER-negative disease and TNBC (OR = 2.44, P = 0.034 and OR = 3.79; P = 0.009, respectively). In a country-restricted analysis, we confirmed the associations detected for FANCM:p.Arg658* and found that also FANCM:p.Arg1931* was associated with ER-negative breast cancer risk (OR = 1.96; P = 0.006). The functional results indicated that all three variants were deleterious affecting cell survival and chromosome stability with FANCM:p.Arg658* causing more severe phenotypes. In conclusion, we confirmed that the two rare FANCM deleterious variants p.Arg658* and p.Arg1931* are risk factors for ER-negative and TNBC subtypes. Overall our data suggest that the effect of truncating variants on breast cancer risk may depend on their position in the gene. Cell sensitivity to olaparib exposure, identifies a possible therapeutic option to treat FANCM-associated tumors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Uveitis is a frequent and early feature of sarcoidosis. As BTNL2 (butyrophilin-like 2) gene polymorphism was found linked with the susceptibility to sarcoidosis, we investigated whether a specific genotype of BTNL2 gene G16071A (or rs2076530) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) would be associated with the risk of sarcoid uveitis in all patient subgroups.
METHODS: The study compared the genotype frequencies of SNP G16071A of 135 patients with sarcoid uveitis (Sa+Uv+) with those of 196 patients with sarcoidosis without uveitis (Sa+Uv-), 81 patients with uveitis without sarcoidosis (Sa-Uv+), and 271 controls with no sarcoidosis nor uveitis (Sa-Uv-). Three hypothetical subgroups of patients with sarcoid uveitis (Sa+Uv+ cases) were considered: (1) subgroup I: patients aged {\textless}45 years of both sexes and all ethnic origins; (2) subgroup II: Caucasian women aged {\textgreater}45 years; and (3) subgroup III: all other patients.
RESULTS: A statistically significant difference in genotype frequencies was found between the groups Sa+Uv- and Sa-Uv- (p=3.2×10-6) and between the groups Sa+Uv+ and Sa+Uv- (p=7.1×10-3). There was no difference between the three subgroups of Sa+Uv+ patients. There was a statistically significant difference in genotype frequencies between Sa+Uv- and Sa+Uv+ subgroup II (p=0.005) but no difference between Sa+Uv- and Sa+Uv+ subgroup I.
CONCLUSION: No association was found between G16071A and the susceptibility to sarcoid uveitis. BTNL2 gene G16071A SNP seems to be a predisposing factor for sarcoidosis except in Caucasian postmenopausal women with sarcoid uveitis in whom the GG genotype prevails. These and future results will help in understanding differences between particular subgroups of patients with sarcoid uveitis.},

	abstract = {In 2015, the ACMG-AMP guidelines provided a general procedure for the objective and reproducible classification of genomic variants. While the benefits of this framework are of major importance, its adaptation for locus-specific use is needed. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) occurs due to inactivating mutations in the tumour suppressor gene MEN1, including 20\% of missense variants. The classification of these variants may be extremely challenging. Here, we compared the interpretation of the 122 MEN1 missense variants, identified in the French population over the past 15 years by the TENGEN network (French oncogenetics network of neuroendocrine tumors) versus by using the ACMG-AMP guidelines, and analyzed the causes of discordance. A total of 59.8\% of missense variants were termed as (likely)-pathogenic variants by TENGEN versus only 28.7\% using ACMG-AMP guidelines. Actually, 53.4\% (39/73) of TENGEN (likely)-pathogenic variants were declassified in variant of uncertain significance (VUS) by using ACMG-AMP guidelines, thereby affecting the clinical management of patients and their families. Twenty of these ACMG-AMP VUS were found in patients with a clinically authentic MEN1 disease. Here, TENGEN proposes adjustments to the ACMG-AMP framework for the interpretation of MEN1 missense variants. These propositions merge both the classification systems, and are particularly interesting, as MEN1 is included in the ACMG secondary findings list for reporting in clinical genomic sequencing.},

	abstract = {Context: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by mutations in the MEN1 gene characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, of which the most frequent are primary hyperparathyroidism, pituitary adenomas, and neuroendocrine tumors.
Objective: The aim of this work was to facilitate interpretation of variants and improve the genetic counseling and medical care of families of patients with MEN1.
Design, Setting, and Patients: The TENGEN network (Oncogenetics Network of Neuroendocrine Tumors) has interpreted and collected all allelic variants and clinical characteristics of the MEN1-positive patients identified through genetic testing performed in the French population from 1997 to 2015. Patients and their variants were registered in the locus-specific UMD-MEN1 database (www.umd.be/MEN1/).
Main Outcomes: Variant classification, age-related penetrance, and odds ratios.
Results: A total of 370 distinct variants reported in 1676 patients, including 181 unpublished variants, have been registered. This database analysis revealed a low frequency (6.6\%) of benign or likely benign missense variants in MEN1. Eight families (1.9\%) had members with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism and harbored the same mutations as that found in families with authentic MEN1. An association existed between large rearrangements and an earlier onset of the disease, whereas no difference was observed between truncating and nontruncating variants.
Conclusion: The UMD-MEN1 database provides an exhaustive overview of the MEN1 variants present in the French population. For each variant, a classification is publicly available. Clinical data collections allow the determination of genotype-phenotype correlation and age-related penetrance of lesions in the cohort.},

It is characterized by an increased risk of various cancers including colorectal and endometrial cancers. Early diagnosis of these patients allows for appropriate surveillance and improves survival rates. Differentiating between patients who should undergo genetic testing and those for whom it is not necessary is difficult despite various established criteria (Amsterdam and Bethesda). Often, health professionals meet in multidisciplinary committees (MDC) to discuss patient cases regarding Lynch syndrome. In this study, we evaluated if the prediction model PREMM1,2,6 could be used to enhance MDC decision-making and whether it should be included in our own routine practice and in those of other French teams. Using the prediction model in our cohort would have avoided 12\% of the analyses recommended by our MDC. Furthermore, all patients with a mutation in one of the MMR genes would have been detected. In addition, according to the model, we should have provided 20\% more genetic testing, which suggests that the decision-making criteria used by the professionals in our MDC, was too restrictive. These results suggest that PREMM1,2,6 should be used in current practice to validate the decisions of the MDC before genetic testing is performed in complex cases. The model should be added as a major quality criterion for genetic testing, along with somatic tests, as previously reported in the literature.},

Here we analyse 438 SNPs in this region in 46,451 BC and 15,438 OC cases, 15,252 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 73,444 controls and identify 13 candidate causal SNPs associated with serous OC (P=9.2 × 10(-20)), ER-negative BC (P=1.1 × 10(-13)), BRCA1-associated BC (P=7.7 × 10(-16)) and triple negative BC (P-diff=2 × 10(-5)). Genotype-gene expression associations are identified for candidate target genes ANKLE1 (P=2 × 10(-3)) and ABHD8 (P{\textless}2 × 10(-3)). Chromosome conformation capture identifies interactions between four candidate SNPs and ABHD8, and luciferase assays indicate six risk alleles increased transactivation of the ADHD8 promoter. Targeted deletion of a region containing risk SNP rs56069439 in a putative enhancer induces ANKLE1 downregulation; and mRNA stability assays indicate functional effects for an ANKLE1 3'-UTR SNP. Altogether, these data suggest that multiple SNPs at 19p13 regulate ABHD8 and perhaps ANKLE1 expression, and indicate common mechanisms underlying breast and ovarian cancer risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: MEN1, which is secondary to the mutation of the MEN1 gene, is a rare autosomal-dominant disease that predisposes mutation carriers to endocrine tumors. Most studies demonstrated the absence of direct genotype-phenotype correlations. The existence of a higher risk of death in the Groupe d'étude des Tumeurs Endocrines-cohort associated with a mutation in the JunD interacting domain suggests heterogeneity across families in disease expressivity. This study aims to assess the existence of modifying genetic factors by estimating the intrafamilial correlations and heritability of the six main tumor types in MEN1.
METHODS: The study included 797 patients from 265 kindred and studied seven phenotypic criteria: parathyroid and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and pituitary, adrenal, bronchial, and thymic (thNET) tumors and the presence of metastasis. Intrafamilial correlations and heritability estimates were calculated from family tree data using specific validated statistical analysis software.
RESULTS: Intrafamilial correlations were significant and decreased along parental degrees distance for pituitary, adrenal and thNETs. The heritability of these three tumor types was consistently strong and significant with 64\% (s.e.m.=0.13; P{\textless}0.001) for pituitary tumor, 65\% (s.e.m.=0.21; P{\textless}0.001) for adrenal tumors, and 97\% (s.e.m.=0.41; P=0.006) for thNETs.
CONCLUSION: The present study shows the existence of modifying genetic factors for thymus, adrenal, and pituitary MEN1 tumor types. The identification of at-risk subgroups of individuals within cohorts is the first step toward personalization of care. Next generation sequencing on this subset of tumors will help identify the molecular basis of MEN1 variable genetic expressivity.},

	abstract = {Infantile spasms syndrome (ISs) is characterized by clinical spasms with ictal electrodecrement, usually occurring before the age of 1 year and frequently associated with cognitive impairment. Etiology is widely heterogeneous, the cause remaining elusive in 40\% of patients. We searched for de novo mutations in 10 probands with ISs and their parents using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Patients had neither consanguinity nor family history of epilepsy. Common causes of ISs were excluded by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), metabolic screening, array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and testing for mutations in CDKL5, STXBP1, and for ARX duplications. We found a probably pathogenic mutation in four patients. Missense mutations in SCN2A (p.Leu1342Pro) and KCNQ2 (p.Ala306Thr) were found in two patients with no history of epilepsy before the onset of ISs. The p.Asn107Ser missense mutation of ALG13 had been previously reported in four females with ISs. The fourth mutation was an in-frame deletion (p.Phe110del) in NR2F1, a gene whose mutations cause intellectual disability, epilepsy, and optic atrophy. In addition, we found a possibly pathogenic variant in KIF3C that encodes a kinesin expressed during neural development.

	abstract = {While interplay between BRCA1 and AURKA-RHAMM-TPX2-TUBG1 regulates mammary epithelial polarization, common genetic variation in HMMR (gene product RHAMM) may be associated with risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 mutation carriers. Following on these observations, we further assessed the link between the AURKA-HMMR-TPX2-TUBG1 functional module and risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers. Forty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 15,252 BRCA1 and 8,211 BRCA2 mutation carriers and subsequently analyzed using a retrospective likelihood approach. The association of HMMR rs299290 with breast cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers was confirmed: per-allele hazard ratio (HR) = 1.10, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.15, p = 1.9 x 10(-4) (false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p = 0.043). Variation in CSTF1, located next to AURKA, was also found to be associated with breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers: rs2426618 per-allele HR = 1.10, 95\% CI 1.03-1.16, p = 0.005 (FDR-adjusted p = 0.045). Assessment of pairwise interactions provided suggestions (FDR-adjusted pinteraction values {\textgreater} 0.05) for deviations from the multiplicative model for rs299290 and CSTF1 rs6064391, and rs299290 and TUBG1 rs11649877 in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Following these suggestions, the expression of HMMR and AURKA or TUBG1 in sporadic breast tumors was found to potentially interact, influencing patients' survival. Together, the results of this study support the hypothesis of a causative link between altered function of AURKA-HMMR-TPX2-TUBG1 and breast carcinogenesis in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 12 epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) susceptibility alleles. The pattern of association at these loci is consistent in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers who are at high risk of EOC. After imputation to 1000 Genomes Project data, we assessed associations of 11 million genetic variants with EOC risk from 15,437 cases unselected for family history and 30,845 controls and from 15,252 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 8,211 BRCA2 mutation carriers (3,096 with ovarian cancer), and we combined the results in a meta-analysis. This new study design yielded increased statistical power, leading to the discovery of six new EOC susceptibility loci. Variants at 1p36 (nearest gene, WNT4), 4q26 (SYNPO2), 9q34.2 (ABO) and 17q11.2 (ATAD5) were associated with EOC risk, and at 1p34.3 (RSPO1) and 6p22.1 (GPX6) variants were specifically associated with the serous EOC subtype, all with P {\textless} 5 × 10(-8). Incorporating these variants into risk assessment tools will improve clinical risk predictions for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.},

	abstract = {Infantile Spasms syndrome (ISs) is a characterized by epileptic spasms occurring in clusters with an onset in the first year of life. West syndrome represents a subset of ISs that associates spasms in clusters, a hypsarrhythmia EEG pattern and a developmental arrest or regression. Aetiology of ISs is widely heterogeneous including many genetic causes. Many patients, however, remain without etiological diagnosis, which is critical for prognostic purpose and genetic counselling. In the present study, we performed genetic screening of 73 patients with different types of ISs by array-CGH and molecular analysis of 5 genes: CDKL5, STXBP1, KCNQ2, and GRIN2A, whose mutations cause different types of epileptic encephalopathies, including ISs, as well as MAGI2, which was suggested to be related to a subset of ISs. In total, we found a disease-causing mutation or CNV (Copy Number Variation) in 15\% of the patients. These included 6 point mutations found in CDKL5 (n = 3) and STXBP1 (n = 3), 3 microdeletions (10 Mb in 2q24.3, 3.2 Mb in 5q14.3 including the region upstream to MEF2C, and 256 kb in 9q34 disrupting EHMT1), and 2 microduplications (671 kb in 2q24.3 encompassing SCN2A, and 11.93 Mb in Xq28). In addition, we discuss 3 CNVs as potential risk factors, including one 16p12.1 deletion, one intronic deletion of the NEDD4 gene, and one intronic deletion of CALN1 gene. The present findings highlight the efficacy of combined cytogenetic and targeted mutation screening to improve the diagnostic yield in patient with ISs.},

	volume = {31},
	issn = {2532-179X},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is a polygenic immune disorder disease with predominant manifestations in the lung. BTNL2 gene polymorphisms were previously linked to susceptibility to sarcoidosis. Relationships between sarcoidosis and cancers have been suspected for a long time but little evidence has been reported until now, and recent works show a link between butyrophilin family proteins and anti tumor immunity.
METHODS: We studied the polymorphism of the rs2076530 SNP of BTNL2 gene in 35 patients with sarcoidosis and cancer compared to 340 sarcoidosis without cancer, 271 controls and 32 cancer matched controls.
RESULTS: We found no association between BTNL2 genotype and cancer risk in sarcoidosis (OR: 2,34; CI95\%: 1,30 - 4,20; p = 0,15). Sarcoidosis is associated with the rs2076530SNP of BTNL2 gene. The AA genotype is significantly associated with a 3 more increased risk of sarcoidosis compared to the GG genotype in a co-dominant model (OR: 3,22; CI95\%: 2,58 - 4,06; p {\textless} 0.0001). The AG genotype is associated with a 1,8 more increased risk (OR: 1,79; CI95\%: 1,42 - 2,26).
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm the association of BTNL2 rs2076530SNP with the susceptibility to develop sarcoidosis, but not with an increased risk of cancer in these patients.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant inherited syndrome, related to mutations in the MEN1 gene. Controversial data suggest that the nonsynonymous p.Ala541Thr variant, usually considered as a non-pathogenic polymorphism, may be associated with an increased risk of MEN1-related lesions in carriers.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the pathogenic influence of the p.Ala541Thr variant on clinical and functional outcomes.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed a series of 55 index patients carrying the p.Ala541Thr variant. Their clinical profile was compared to that of 117 MEN1 patients. The biological impact of the p.Ala541Thr variant on cell growth was additionally investigated on menin-deficient Leydig cell tumour (LCT)10 cells generated from Men1+/Men1- heterozygous knock-out mice, and compared with wild type (WT).
RESULTS: The mean age at first appearance of endocrine lesions was similar in both p.Ala541Thr carriers and MEN1 patients, but no p.Ala541Thr patient had more than one cardinal MEN1 lesion at initial diagnosis. A second MEN1 lesion was diagnosed in 13\% of MEN1 patients and in 7\% of p.Ala541Thr carriers in the year following preliminary diagnosis. Functional studies on LCT10 cells showed that overexpression of the p.Ala541Thr variant did not inhibit cell growth, which is in direct contrast to results obtained from investigation of WT menin protein.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, these data raise the question of a potential pathogenicity of the p.Ala541Thr missense variant of menin that commonly occurs within the general population. Additional studies are required to investigate whether it may be involved in a low-penetrance MEN1 phenotype.},

	abstract = {Mutations of the CDKL5 gene cause early epileptic encephalopathy. Patients manifest refractory epilepsy, beginning before the age of 3 months, which is associated with severe psychomotor delay and features that overlap with Rett syndrome. We report here a patient with mosaicism for CDKL5 exonic deletion, with the presence of two mutant alleles. The affected 4-year-old girl presented with infantile spasms, beginning at the age of 9 months, but subsequent progression of the disease was consistent with the classical CDKL5-related phenotype. A deletion of exons 17 and 18 was suspected on the basis of Multiplex Ligation Probe Amplification analysis, but unexpected results for cDNA analysis, which showed the presence of an abnormal transcript with the deletion of exon 18 only, led us to suspect that two distinct events might have occurred. We used custom array-CGH to determine the size and breakpoints of these deletions. Exon 18 was deleted from one of the abnormal alleles, and exon 17 was deleted from the other. A Fork Stalling and Template Switching (FoSTeS) mechanism was proposed to explain the two events, given the presence of regions of microhomology at the breakpoints. We propose here an original involvement of the FoSTeS mechanism to explain the co-occurrence of these two events in the CDKL5 gene in a single patient.

	doi = {10.1186/s13058-014-0492-9},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: More than 70 common alleles are known to be involved in breast cancer (BC) susceptibility, and several exhibit significant heterogeneity in their associations with different BC subtypes. Although there are differences in the association patterns between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers and the general population for several loci, no study has comprehensively evaluated the associations of all known BC susceptibility alleles with risk of BC subtypes in BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers.
METHODS: We used data from 15,252 BRCA1 and 8,211 BRCA2 carriers to analyze the associations between approximately 200,000 genetic variants on the iCOGS array and risk of BC subtypes defined by estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and triple-negative- (TN) status; morphologic subtypes; histological grade; and nodal involvement.
RESULTS: The estimated BC hazard ratios (HRs) for the 74 known BC alleles in BRCA1 carriers exhibited moderate correlations with the corresponding odds ratios from the general population. However, their associations with ER-positive BC in BRCA1 carriers were more consistent with the ER-positive associations in the general population (intraclass correlation (ICC) = 0.61, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.45 to 0.74), and the same was true when considering ER-negative associations in both groups (ICC = 0.59, 95\% CI: 0.42 to 0.72). Similarly, there was strong correlation between the ER-positive associations for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers (ICC = 0.67, 95\% CI: 0.52 to 0.78), whereas ER-positive associations in any one of the groups were generally inconsistent with ER-negative associations in any of the others. After stratifying by ER status in mutation carriers, additional significant associations were observed. Several previously unreported variants exhibited associations at P {\textless}10(-6) in the analyses by PR status, HER2 status, TN phenotype, morphologic subtypes, histological grade and nodal involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Differences in associations of common BC susceptibility alleles between BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers and the general population are explained to a large extent by differences in the prevalence of ER-positive and ER-negative tumors. Estimates of the risks associated with these variants based on population-based studies are likely to be applicable to mutation carriers after taking ER status into account, which has implications for risk prediction.},

In addition to benign familial neonatal epilepsy (BFNE), KCNQ2 mutations have been recently found in families with one or more family members with a severe outcome, including drug-resistant seizures with psychomotor retardation, electroencephalogram (EEG) suppression-burst pattern (Ohtahara syndrome), and distinct neuroradiological features, a condition that was named "KCNQ2 encephalopathy." In the present article, we describe clinical, genetic, and functional data from 17 patients/families whose electroclinical presentation was consistent with the diagnosis of BFNE. Sixteen different heterozygous mutations were found in KCNQ2, including 10 substitutions, three insertions/deletions and three large deletions. One substitution was found in KCNQ3. Most of these mutations were novel, except for four KCNQ2 substitutions that were shown to be recurrent. Electrophysiological studies in mammalian cells revealed that homomeric or heteromeric KCNQ2 and/or KCNQ3 channels carrying mutant subunits with newly found substitutions displayed reduced current densities. In addition, we describe, for the first time, that some mutations impair channel regulation by syntaxin-1A, highlighting a novel pathogenetic mechanism for KCNQ2-related epilepsies.},

	abstract = {Functional consequences of mutations in predisposition genes for familial cancer syndromes remain often elusive, especially when the corresponding gene products play pleiotropic functions and interact with numerous partners. Understanding the consequences of these genetic alterations requires access to their functional effects at the phenotypic level. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has emerged as a promising functional genomics probe, through its ability to monitor the consequences of genetic variations at the biochemical level. Here, we determine by NMR the metabolic perturbations associated with different disease-related mutations in the MEN1 gene, responsible for the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome, type 1 (MEN1), an example of hereditary cancer. The MEN1 gene encodes the Menin protein. Based on a cellular model that allows exogenous overexpression of either the wild type (WT) Menin protein or disease-related variant forms, we evaluate the feasibility of using metabolic profiles to discriminate cells with WT versus variant Menin overexpression. High-resolution magic angle spinning (HRMAS) NMR of whole cells allows to determine the metabolic features associated with overexpression of WT Menin as compared to the one of six different missense variants observed in MEN1 patients. We then identify several statistically significant individual metabolites associated with the metabolic signature of pathogenic versus WT variants. Whether such a metabolic phenotyping approach using cell lines could be exploited as a functional test in a human genetic cancer syndrome is further discussed.},

	abstract = {The protein MENIN is the product of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN1) gene. Altered MENIN expression is one of the few events that are clearly associated with foregut neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), classical oncogenes or tumour suppressors being not involved. One of the current challenges is to understand how alteration of MENIN expression contributes to the development of these tumours. We hypothesised that MENIN might regulate factors maintaining endocrine-differentiated functions. We chose the insulinoma model, a paradigmatic example of well-differentiated pancreatic NETs, to study whether MENIN interferes with the expression of v-MAF musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homologue A (MAFA), a master glucose-dependent transcription factor in differentiated β-cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of a series of human insulinomas revealed a correlated decrease in both MENIN and MAFA. Decreased MAFA expression resulting from targeted Men1 ablation was also consistently observed in mouse insulinomas. In vitro analyses using insulinoma cell lines showed that MENIN regulated MAFA protein and mRNA levels, and bound to Mafa promoter sequences. MENIN knockdown concomitantly decreased mRNA expression of both Mafa and β-cell differentiation markers (Ins1/2, Gck, Slc2a2 and Pdx1) and, in parallel, increased the proliferation rate of tumours as measured by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. Interestingly, MAFA knockdown alone also increased proliferation rate but did not affect the expression of candidate proliferation genes regulated by MENIN. Finally, MENIN variants with missense mutations detected in patients with MEN1 lost the WT MENIN properties to regulate MAFA. Together, our findings unveil a previously unsuspected MENIN/MAFA connection regarding control of the β-cell differentiation/proliferation balance, which could contribute to tumorigenesis.},

We found that 76 \% of centers regularly use MDCs for the management of hereditary digestive cancers. Familial colon cancer cases were the most common situation, in which MDCs were utilized. Participation of various medical specialists was reported as follows: geneticists (100 \%), gastroenterologists (76 \%), genetic counselors (84 \%), surgeons (32 \%), and biologists (36 \%). Twenty percent of centers consult MDCs for every patient compared to 80 \% of centers that use MDCs only for select cases.

	abstract = {BRCA1-associated breast and ovarian cancer risks can be modified by common genetic variants. To identify further cancer risk-modifying loci, we performed a multi-stage GWAS of 11,705 BRCA1 carriers (of whom 5,920 were diagnosed with breast and 1,839 were diagnosed with ovarian cancer), with a further replication in an additional sample of 2,646 BRCA1 carriers. We identified a novel breast cancer risk modifier locus at 1q32 for BRCA1 carriers (rs2290854, P = 2.7 × 10(-8), HR = 1.14, 95\% CI: 1.09-1.20). In addition, we identified two novel ovarian cancer risk modifier loci: 17q21.31 (rs17631303, P = 1.4 × 10(-8), HR = 1.27, 95\% CI: 1.17-1.38) and 4q32.3 (rs4691139, P = 3.4 × 10(-8), HR = 1.20, 95\% CI: 1.17-1.38). The 4q32.3 locus was not associated with ovarian cancer risk in the general population or BRCA2 carriers, suggesting a BRCA1-specific association. The 17q21.31 locus was also associated with ovarian cancer risk in 8,211 BRCA2 carriers (P = 2×10(-4)). These loci may lead to an improved understanding of the etiology of breast and ovarian tumors in BRCA1 carriers. Based on the joint distribution of the known BRCA1 breast cancer risk-modifying loci, we estimated that the breast cancer lifetime risks for the 5\% of BRCA1 carriers at lowest risk are 28\%-50\% compared to 81\%-100\% for the 5\% at highest risk. Similarly, based on the known ovarian cancer risk-modifying loci, the 5\% of BRCA1 carriers at lowest risk have an estimated lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer of 28\% or lower, whereas the 5\% at highest risk will have a risk of 63\% or higher. Such differences in risk may have important implications for risk prediction and clinical management for BRCA1 carriers.},

	abstract = {Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1 (MEN1), which is secondary to mutation of the MEN1 gene, is a rare autosomal-dominant disease that predisposes mutation carriers to endocrine tumors. Although genotype-phenotype studies have so far failed to identify any statistical correlations, some families harbor recurrent tumor patterns. The function of MENIN is unclear, but has been described through the discovery of its interacting partners. Mutations in the interacting domains of MENIN functional partners have been shown to directly alter its regulation abilities. We report on a cohort of MEN1 patients from the Groupe d'étude des Tumeurs Endocrines. Patients with a molecular diagnosis and a clinical follow-up, totaling 262 families and 806 patients, were included. Associations between mutation type, location or interacting factors of the MENIN protein and death as well as the occurrence of MEN1-related tumors were tested using a frailty Cox model to adjust for potential heterogeneity across families. Accounting for the heterogeneity across families, the overall risk of death was significantly higher when mutations affected the JunD interacting domain (adjusted HR = 1.88: 95\%-CI = 1.15-3.07). Patients had a higher risk of death from cancers of the MEN1 spectrum (HR = 2.34; 95\%-CI = 1.23-4.43). This genotype-phenotype correlation study confirmed the lack of direct genotype-phenotype correlations. However, patients with mutations affecting the JunD interacting domain had a higher risk of death secondary to a MEN1 tumor and should thus be considered for surgical indications, genetic counseling and follow-up.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Diagnostic screening of the BRCA1/2 genes in breast cancer families is mostly done on genomic DNA. For families with a very strong family history and no mutation identified in the coding sequences or the exon-intron boundaries, BRCA1/2 transcripts' analysis is an efficient approach to uncover gene inversion and pre-mRNA splicing defaults missed by conventional DNA-based protocols.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed RNA from patients of negative BRCA families by reverse transcriptase PCR and identified an insertion in one family that we characterized by sequencing and by using a minigene splicing assay. More than 2,000 additional BRCA1/2 negative families were subsequently screened for this mutation using a dedicated PCR approach.
RESULTS: Nine families were found to harbor a BRCA2 mutant transcript containing a 95-nucleotide cryptic exon between exons 12 and 13. This cryptic exon results from a new mutation located deep into intron 12, c.6937+594T {\textgreater} G, which reinforces the strength of a preexisting 5' splice site, turning it into a perfect consensus sequence. It is systematically included in transcripts produced by the mutant allele in cells from mutation carriers or produced by a mutant splicing reporter minigene. The inclusion of the cryptic exon was prevented when we cotransfected the minigene with antisense oligonucleotides complementary to the 3' or mutated 5' splice sites.
CONCLUSION: This first deep intronic BRCA mutation emphasizes the importance of analyzing RNA to provide comprehensive BRCA1/2 diagnostic tests and opens the possibility of using antisense therapy in the future as an alternative strategy for cancer prevention.},

We looked for mutations in these 5 genes in a series of 269 patients with paragangliomas and/or pheochromocytomas. The SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD genes were analyzed in a series of 269 unrelated index patients with paragangliomas and/or pheochromocytomas using dHPLC screening of point mutations followed by direct sequencing and Multiplex PCR Liquid Chromatography to detect large rearrangements confirmed by quantitative PCR. In a second phase, we adapted Multiplex PCR Liquid Chromatography to the SDHAF2 and TMEM127 genes. This method and direct sequencing were applied to 230 patients without the SDHB, C, D mutations. Of the 269 patients, 44 carried a mutation (16.3\%). Thirty-seven different mutations were identified: 18 in SDHB (including 2 large deletions), 8 in SDHD, 6 in SDHC, 5 in TMEM127, and no mutations in SDHAF2. Thirteen mutations have not been published so far. An exhaustive study of the different genes is needed to make possible a familial genetic diagnosis in paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma hereditary syndromes. Although mutations in SDHC and TMEM127 are less frequent than mutations in SDHB and SDHD, they also have less evident clinical feature indicators. Analyzing SDHAF2 must be restricted to familial extra-adrenal paragangliomas. Multiplex PCR Liquid Chromatography is a sensitive, fast, and inexpensive method for screening large rearrangements, which are infrequent in these syndromes.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Several common alleles have been shown to be associated with breast and/or ovarian cancer risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Recent genome-wide association studies of breast cancer have identified eight additional breast cancer susceptibility loci: rs1011970 (9p21, CDKN2A/B), rs10995190 (ZNF365), rs704010 (ZMIZ1), rs2380205 (10p15), rs614367 (11q13), rs1292011 (12q24), rs10771399 (12p11 near PTHLH) and rs865686 (9q31.2).
METHODS: To evaluate whether these single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with breast cancer risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, we genotyped these SNPs in 12,599 BRCA1 and 7,132 BRCA2 mutation carriers and analysed the associations with breast cancer risk within a retrospective likelihood framework.
RESULTS: Only SNP rs10771399 near PTHLH was associated with breast cancer risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers (per-allele hazard ratio (HR) = 0.87, 95\% CI: 0.81 to 0.94, P-trend = 3 × 10-4). The association was restricted to mutations proven or predicted to lead to absence of protein expression (HR = 0.82, 95\% CI: 0.74 to 0.90, P-trend = 3.1 × 10-5, P-difference = 0.03). Four SNPs were associated with the risk of breast cancer for BRCA2 mutation carriers: rs10995190, P-trend = 0.015; rs1011970, P-trend = 0.048; rs865686, 2df-P = 0.007; rs1292011 2df-P = 0.03. rs10771399 (PTHLH) was predominantly associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer for BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR = 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.74 to 0.90, P-trend = 4 × 10-5) and there was marginal evidence of association with ER-negative breast cancer for BRCA2 mutation carriers (HR = 0.78, 95\% CI: 0.62 to 1.00, P-trend = 0.049).
CONCLUSIONS: The present findings, in combination with previously identified modifiers of risk, will ultimately lead to more accurate risk prediction and an improved understanding of the disease etiology in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.},

A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified six alleles associated with risk of ovarian cancer for women in the general population. We evaluated four of these loci as potential modifiers of ovarian cancer risk for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs10088218 (at 8q24), rs2665390 (at 3q25), rs717852 (at 2q31), and rs9303542 (at 17q21), were genotyped in 12,599 BRCA1 and 7,132 BRCA2 carriers, including 2,678 ovarian cancer cases. Associations were evaluated within a retrospective cohort approach. All four loci were associated with ovarian cancer risk in BRCA2 carriers; rs10088218 per-allele hazard ratio (HR) = 0.81 (95\% CI: 0.67-0.98) P-trend = 0.033, rs2665390 HR = 1.48 (95\% CI: 1.21-1.83) P-trend = 1.8 × 10(-4), rs717852 HR = 1.25 (95\% CI: 1.10-1.42) P-trend = 6.6 × 10(-4), rs9303542 HR = 1.16 (95\% CI: 1.02-1.33) P-trend = 0.026.

	abstract = {The Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome is associated with cutaneous disorders including fibrofolliculomas and trichodiscomas, and also lung pneumatocysts and kidney tumours. The BHD syndrome occurs as a consequence of an autosomal dominantly inherited genodermatosis, linked to multiple germline mutations in the 14 exons of the BHD gene, mapped on 17p11.2 and encoding for folliculin (FLCN). The size and number of lung pneumatocysts are extremely variable and the cysts are surrounded by normal pulmonary tissue. In the absence of smoking lung function is usually unimpaired. The lung cysts are frequently complicated by the development of recurrent pneumothoraces. Treatment of pneumothorax in patients with the BHD syndrome is similar to the approach taken for patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. Lung cysts in the BHD syndrome are a rare cause of cystic pulmonary lesions. However, they must be systematically evaluated since kidney tumours occur in one third of patients. We report a case of classical BHD syndrome with specific cutaneous involvement, recurrent pneumothoraces complicating lung cysts, an exon 12 germline mutation on BHD gene and a familial history suggesting other related cases. This observation allows us to update this orphan disease, to consider BHD in the differential diagnosis of lung cysts and, above all, to highlight the high frequency and the prognostic significance of associated kidney tumours.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten uveal melanomas enucleated between 2005 and 2008 in the Lyon Croix-Rousse Hospital were retrospectively analyzed using a 19 000-clone comparative genomic hybridization microarray.
RESULTS: The most frequent imbalances were the loss of chromosome 3 (8/10), gain of the 8q arm (7/10) or the entire chromosome 8 (2/10), and gain of the 6p arm (2/10). Most metastatic tumors (6/7) and all cases of death (5/5) concerned melanoma with monosomy 3 and gain of the 8q arm.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Genome-wide array comparative genomic hybridization is a reliable tool for identifying uveal melanoma genomic imbalances. Gains of the 8q arm with monosomy 3 are frequent and are strongly associated with poor outcome. Gains of the 6p arm are rare and have a better prognosis. There is a mutually exclusive relationship between monosomy 3 and chromosome 6 abnormalities in our study. These results confirm previously published reports.},

This approach aimed to identify the impact of a 4.1R splicing mutation. This mutation is involved in a partial deficiency of 4.1R in the homozygous state in a patient with hereditary elliptocytosis and a moderated hemolytic anemia. We show that, in addition to two known minor shortened and stable spliceoforms, the mutation activates an intronic cryptic splice site, which results in a nonsense mRNA major isoform, targeted to degradation in intact cells by NMD. This accounts for the main cause of 4.1R partial deficiency. In a general perspective, blocking the NMD mechanism would help to identify a missing isoform, and pave the path for a molecular targeting strategy to circumvent a deleterious splicing pathway in favor of a therapeutic splicing pathway.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Lafora disease (LD) is an autosomal recessive form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy with onset in childhood or adolescence and with fatal outcome caused by mutations in two genes: EPM2A and NHLRC1. The aim of this study was to characterize the mutation spectrum in a cohort of unrelated patients with presumed LD.
METHODS: Sequencing of the two genes and search for large rearrangements was performed in 46 unrelated patients with suspected LD, 33 originating from France and the others from different countries. Patients were classified into two groups according to the clinical presentation.
RESULTS: Mutations of various types were found in EPM2A in 10 patients and in NHLRC1 in 4 patients. Mutations were found in 14 (93\%) of 15 patients with classical clinical and electroencephalography (EEG) presentation of LD and in no patients with an atypical presentation. Ten mutations were novel, including the first substitution reported in a donor splice site of EPM2A, leading to the deletion of exon 2 at the RNA level. Four large deletions, including two deletions of exon 2 with different sizes and breakpoints, were found in EPM2A, corresponding to 20\% of the alleles of this gene.
DISCUSSION: We described several novel mutations of EPM2A and NHLRC1 and brought additional data to the genetic epidemiology of LD. This study emphasized the high mutation rate in patients with classical LD as well as the high negativity rate of skin biopsy.},

	abstract = {Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and type 2 (MEN2) are major genetic disorders carrying a high risk of endocrine tumor development. The mutated genes were identified in 1993 (MEN2-RET) and 1997 (MEN1), enabling genetic testing and functional studies. Genetic analysis has led to new clinical and therapeutic strategies for MEN1/2 patients, and has improved our understanding of the pathways underlying the development of such tumors, which occur in an autosomal dominant manner and with high penetrance. The MEN1 gene encodes menin, a protein involved in many cell functions, such as transcription, genome stability, cell cycling and apoptosis. The MEN1 gene has 10 exons, and its exhaustive analysis in MEN1 patients helps guide their management. MEN2 is related to activating missense mutations in the RET protooncogene, which encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR). RET activation occurs upon autodimerization induced by the binding of specific ligands belonging to glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor-like family (GFL) proteins, regulated by coreceptors. The position of missense mutations--in the extracellular or intracellular TK domains--influences the aggressiveness of the most frequent malignancy, medullary thyroid carcinoma, establishing a genotype-phenotype correlation. We also briefly describe the genetic basis of three other inherited states predisposing individuals to endocrine tumors, namely Carney's syndrome, hyperparathyroidism type 2 (HRPT2) and familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA), which are related to inactivating mutations in the PRKAR1-alpha, HRPT2 and AIP genes, respectively.},

	volume = {26},
	issn = {1124-0490},
	abstract = {RATIONALE: Despite extensive studies, the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis is largely unknown. Although multiple environmental and putative infectious agents have been proposed, none was retained as a major contributor to the disease occurrence. Genetic predisposition to sarcoidosis was considered as a significant factor and numerous candidate genes have been reviewed. This last point was reinforced since the discovery of a pathogenic polymorphism (rs2076530 or G {\textgreater} A) of the BTNL2 gene, leading to an early truncation of the protein, which increases the relative risk of the disease. BTNL2 is known to act as a co-stimulatory molecule, inducing a negative signal to T-lymphocyte activation and the mutated gene is responsible for a truncated protein and disruption of membrane localization.
OBJECTIVES: Our work attempted to confirm this observation in a highly penetrant familial form of sarcoidosis.
RESULTS: In this family, the disease was diagnosed in 5 members through 3 generations. Despite individual clinical specificities, all displayed severe forms of the disease. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 3 patients and 2 additional healthy children of the fourth generation. Analysis of the BTNL2 gene confirmed the presence of the pathogenic variant of BTNL2 on both alleles (A/A homozygous genotype) in all subjects tested.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the absence of a membrane anchored BTNL2 protein may increase genetic susceptibility to sarcoidosis and familial occurrence of the disease. This observation assessed the putative pathogenic involvement of the rs2076530 variant of BTNL2 in the development of this granulomatosis disease.},

Inactivating PRKAR1A mutations are known to be responsible for the multiple neoplasia and lentiginosis syndrome Carney complex (CNC). To date, at least 117 pathogenic variants in PRKAR1A have been identified (online database: http://prkar1a.nichd.nih.gov). The majority are subject to nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD), leading to RIalpha haploinsufficiency and, as a result, activated cAMP signaling. Recently, it became apparent that CNC may be caused not only by RIalpha haploinsufficiency, but also by the expression of altered RIalpha protein, as proven by analysis of expressed mutations in the gene, consisting of amino acid substitutions and in-frame genetic alterations. In addition, a new subgroup of mutations that potentially escape NMD and result in CNC through altered (rather than missing) protein has been analyzed-these are frame-shifts in the 3' end of the coding sequence that shift the stop codon downstream of the normal one. The mutation detection rate in CNC patients is recently estimated at above 60\%; PRKAR1A mutation-negative CNC patients are characterized by significant phenotypic heterogeneity. In this report, we present a comprehensive analysis of all presently known PRKAR1A sequence variations and discuss their molecular context and clinical phenotype.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) often present with recurrent anemia because of epistaxis or GI bleeding in relation to telangiectases mostly located in the stomach or small bowel. Capsule endoscopy is considered a major diagnostic tool for small-bowel diseases, but the impact of capsule endoscopy imaging on patient management in HHT is poorly understood.
OBJECTIVE: To clarify the contribution of capsule endoscopy in selected patients with HHT.
DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive study.
SETTING: Multicenter, two university hospital tertiary-care centers, from January 2003 to June 2007.
PATIENTS: This study involved 30 patients with HHT and severe anemia (hemoglobin {\textless}9 g/dL; normal: 11-15 g/dL) and minimal epistaxis or moderate anemia but overt GI bleeding.
INTERVENTION: Capsule endoscopy investigation.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Clinical characteristics and capsule endoscopy results and their clinical consequences.
RESULTS: Capsule endoscopy detected gastric and small-bowel telangiectases in 14 (46.7\%) and 26 (86.7\%) cases, respectively. Active bleeding was present in 36.7\% of cases. Diffuse telangiectases were detected in 42.3\% without correlation with age, sex, or type of HHT mutation. Further investigations were carried out as a consequence of the capsule endoscopy results in 67\% of cases. Treatment, consisting mostly of endoscopic argon plasma coagulation, was scheduled in 46.7\% of patients.
LIMITATIONS: Our population was essentially composed of patients with the ALK1 mutation.
CONCLUSION: This study shows that there is a high diagnostic yield for capsule endoscopy in selected patients with HHT. Capsule endoscopy makes possible precise mapping of lesions and has a considerable impact on the management of these selected patients by using a predefined algorithm: a limited number of accessible lesions is suitable for endoscopic treatment, whereas innumerable diffuse lesions require a medical approach. We suggest that capsule endoscopy could be a first-line, noninvasive, digestive tract examination in selected patients with HHT.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The tumor suppressor menin is recognized as a key regulator of pancreatic islet development, proliferation, and beta-cell function, whereas its role in alpha cells remains poorly understood. The purpose of the current study was to address this issue in relation to islet tumor histogenesis.
METHODS: We generated alpha cell-specific Men1 mutant mice with Cre/loxP technology and carried out analyses of pancreatic lesions developed in the mutant mice during aging.
RESULTS: We showed that, despite the alpha-cell specificity of the GluCre transgene, both glucagonomas and a large amount of insulinomas developed in mutant mice older than 6 months, accompanied by mixed islet tumors. Interestingly, the cells sharing characteristics of both alpha and beta cells were identified shortly after the appearance of menin-deficient alpha cells but well before the tumor onset. Using a genetic cell lineage tracing analysis, we demonstrated that insulinoma cells were directly derived from transdifferentiating glucagon-expressing cells. Furthermore, our data indicated that the expression of Pdx1, MafA, Pax4, and Ngn3 did not seem to be required for the initiation of this transdifferentiation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our work shows cell transdifferentiation as a novel mechanism involved in islet tumor development and provides evidence showing that menin regulates the plasticity of differentiated pancreatic alpha cells in vivo, shedding new light on the mechanisms of islet tumorigenesis.},

METHODS: The 761-patient MEN1 cohort from the GTE registry was used (Groupe des Tumeurs Endocrines).
RESULTS: The actuarial probability of occurrence was 2.6\% (range, 1.3-5.5\%) at aged 40 years. All, except one, Th-NET patients were men. Four patients had no other associated lesions. The youngest patient was aged 16 years. Mean age at the time of diagnosis was 42.7 (range, 16.1-67.5) years. The 10-year probability of survival was 36.1\% (range, 11.5-62\%). Seven patients (33\%) belonged to clustered MEN1 families. The spectrum of associated lesions in patients with Th-NET was not statistically different from the spectrum of the remainder of the cohort. Various endocrine markers were high, but none were sensitive or specific enough to be useful for Th-NET detection. CT-scan and MRI were always positive at the time of diagnosis. No particular mutation was found to be associated with Th-NET. Five cases underwent prophylactic thymectomy without success.
CONCLUSIONS: Several end points may be helpful for future guidelines: (1) earlier detection of Th-NET in MEN1 patients is required; (2) screening of both sexes is necessary; (3) a prospective study comparing MRI vs. CT scan in yearly screening for Th-NET is needed; (4) a reinforced screening program must be established for patients who belong to clustered families; and (5) thymectomies must be performed in specialized centers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The "complex of myxomas, spotty skin pigmentation, and endocrine overactivity," or "Carney complex" (CNC), is caused by inactivating mutations of the regulatory subunit type 1A of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PRKAR1A) gene and as yet unknown defect(s) in other gene(s). Delineation of a genotype-phenotype correlation for CNC patients is essential for understanding PRKAR1A function and providing counseling and preventive care.
METHODS: A transatlantic consortium studied the molecular genotype and clinical phenotype of 353 patients (221 females and 132 males, age 34 +/- 19 yr) who carried a germline PRKAR1A mutation or were diagnosed with CNC and/or primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease.
RESULTS: A total of 258 patients (73\%) carried 80 different PRKAR1A mutations; 114 (62\%) of the index cases had a PRKAR1A mutation. Most PRKAR1A mutations (82\%) led to lack of detectable mutant protein (nonexpressed mutations) because of nonsense mRNA mediated decay. Patients with a PRKAR1A mutation were more likely to have pigmented skin lesions, myxomas, and thyroid and gonadal tumors; they also presented earlier with these tumors. Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease occurred earlier, was more frequent in females, and was the only manifestation of CNC with a gender predilection. Mutations located in exons were more often associated with acromegaly, myxomas, lentigines, and schwannomas, whereas the frequent c.491-492delTG mutation was commonly associated with lentigines, cardiac myxomas, and thyroid tumors. Overall, nonexpressed PRKAR1A mutations were associated with less severe disease.
CONCLUSION: CNC is genetically and clinically heterogeneous. Certain tumors are more frequent, with specific mutations providing some genotype-phenotype correlation for PRKAR1A mutations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To present evidence supporting the hypothesis that the coexistence of gastric carcinoids (GCs) and hyperparathyroidism may represent a distinct clinical entity, not related to multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1).
METHODS: We studied a cohort of five young siblings (age range 26-42 years), one of whom had been found to have GC and hyperparathyroidism. All siblings underwent serial gastroscopies for the assessment of gastric neuroendocrine cell proliferations over a mean follow-up period of 31.2 months. Imaging, biochemical and hormonal as well as molecular genetic investigations were performed in the direction of MEN1 syndrome. The literature was searched for cases with coexistence of GCs and hyperparathyroidism not associated with MEN1.
RESULTS: Four of the siblings, all male, were found to have GCs in a background of Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic atrophic gastritis and pernicious anaemia, with no serological evidence of gastric autoimmunity. In two of them, asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism was also present. Screening for MEN1 gene mutations or large deletions was negative, and hormone and imaging investigations did not support a diagnosis of familial MEN1 syndrome. A literature search revealed sporadic reports of cases with GC and hyperparathyroidism not attributable to MEN1.
CONCLUSIONS: The association of GCs and hyperparathyroidism appears to constitute a distinct syndrome that can be encountered in genetically predisposed individuals, and should not be regarded as 'atypical' or 'incomplete' expression of MEN1. Its prevalence and aetiology should be the subject of future studies. Screening for hyperparathyroidism seems to be justified in patients with GC of any type.},

	doi = {10.1053/j.gastro.2008.07.031},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Missense mutations account for 30\% of mutations identified in patients with the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome. They raise several issues: the distinction between pathogenic mutations and polymorphisms is sometimes difficult and the functional effects of missense mutations are unclear. We aimed to evaluate the functional consequences of missense MEN1 mutations in an appropriate endocrine cellular context.
METHODS: From the INS-1 insulinoma cell line, we established clones conditionally over expressing wild-type (WT) menin or its A160T, H317Y, and A541T variants. We compared the consequences of WT or variant menin over expression on apoptotic response after gamma-irradiation and analyzed the interactions of these proteins with p53.
RESULTS: WT menin over expression sensitized INS-r3 cells to apoptosis through amplification of caspase-3 activation, increased p53 acetylation, and accelerated p21 activation; moreover, over expressed WT menin could be recovered in p53-containing complexes. For all 3 missense mutations tested, the functional effects observed with WT were impaired significantly and only low amounts of variant menin proteins were recovered in p53-containing complexes.
CONCLUSIONS: Taking advantage of a new endocrine cellular model, we show a loss of function for 2 missense disease-related menin mutants and for a controversial variant as well. Furthermore, our results suggest the existence of functional interactions between p53 and menin for the control of apoptosis, which may cast new light on the mechanisms of endocrine tumorigenesis.},

Heterozygous Men1 mutant mice previously generated by several laboratories, including ours, mimic largely MEN1 pathology. Interestingly, our heterozygous Men1 mutant mice exhibit not only the endocrine tumours commonly seen in MEN1 patients, but also Leydig cell tumours (LCT) with high frequency, accompanied systematically by loss of the wild-type Men1 allele. As there exists a similarity of tumour phenotype between these mice and those mutated for the components of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH)/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) pathway belonging to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family, we investigated the expression and the activity of this pathway, known to have an important biological role in Leydig cells. Here, we report that the expression of AMH receptor type 2 is reduced in Men1 LCTs. Both immunostaining and western blot analyses also demonstrate a markedly decreased nuclear expression of Smad1, 3, 4 and 5 in the tumours. More interestingly, we show that the reconstituted menin expression in Men1-deficient Leydig cells derived from LCTs can significantly increase the transcriptional activity of a BMP pathway target promoter, XVent2. Furthermore, we found that the expression of p18, p27 and cyclin dependant kinase 4 (Cdk4), targets of TGF-beta pathways, is altered in the Leydig cell lesions. Our data provide the evidence of the deregulation of AMH/BMP and TGF-beta pathways in mouse Men1 LCTs, highlighting their involvement in tumorigenesis of Leydig cells due to Men1 inactivation.},

Pituitary tissue specimens of 77 MEN1 patients from the GTE (Groupe d'étude des Tumeurs Endocrines) register were compared with unselected 2509 non-MEN1 sporadic pituitary tumors and also to a control subgroup of 296 cases, where 1 MEN1 tumor was matched with 4 sporadic tumors of the same hormonal immunoprofile. Sex, age, size, and invasiveness of tumors, and menin gene mutations were documented. Histologic analysis took into account 33 items, including immunocytochemical data, the proliferative marker Ki-67, and an examination of the juxtatumoral pituitary. MEN1 tumors were significantly larger and more often invasive by histology. MEN1 patients with large pituitary tumors (grade IV) were younger than non-MEN1 patients. MEN1 tumors had no other characteristic histologic features and no predominance of any one hormone producing subtype. However, plurihormonal adenomas versus monohormonal and nonimmunoreactive adenomas were more frequent in MEN1 tumors (39\%) than in the control non-MEN1 group (P = 0.001). Especially, the growth hormone and prolactin plurihormonality with unusual association with follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or adrenocorticotropic hormone was more frequent in MEN1 tumors. In addition, multiple adenomas were significantly more frequent (4\% vs. 0.1\%; P {\textless} 0.0001), especially prolactin-adrenocorticotropic hormone. Somatotroph hyperplasia, with or without a microadenoma was found in only 3 MEN1 patients, with growth hormone-releasing hormone hypersecretion by a pancreatic tumor in 2 of them. All types of mutation were observed, including frameshifts, nonsenses, missenses, and 1 case of germline MEN1 encompassing large deletion, strongly suggesting the absence of any phenotype-genotype correlation.},

Two decades ago, a French epidemiological study pointed out that its prevalence was higher than previously thought and that its distribution varied greatly from one area to another, one of the highest concentrations of patients being found in the Haut-Jura mountains. Although germline mutations are usually family specific, some of them have been reported in unrelated patients, especially for ACVRL1. We performed haplotype analysis of 116 French and Italian patients carrying 13 ACVRL1 different mutations. For five of these mutations, we estimated the age of the most recent common ancestors (MRCAs) using the ESTIAGE program. Most mutations were related to both recurrent mutational events and founder effects with age estimates ranging from 100 to 550 years. The c.1112dupG mutation, which is likely to be responsible for the very high concentration of HHT patients found in the former epidemiological study, probably occurred in one inhabitant of the Haut-Jura Mountains more than three centuries ago. The p.Arg374Gln mutation occurred independently in at least two distinct geographical areas, including the area with the second highest prevalence in the epidemiological study and where the MRCA is rather recent (about 100 years ago). Partially shared haplotypes between French and Italian patients were found for three mutations. This suggests a common origin and a possible diffusion of these mutations from Italy to France.},

The most frequently described forms of familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA) are familial somatotropinomas or prolactinomas. Recently, some cases of familial isolated somatotropinoma have been associated with germline mutations in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene. The present report shows heterogeneous FIPA with 3 subtypes of tumor in 3 individuals of the same family: somatotropinoma in the proband, giant prolactinoma in a brother, and gonadotroph cell macroadenoma in the father. A prospective survey also suggested the occurrence of a silent microadenoma in the proband's sister. Clinical screening was performed in the 3 affected members, the 4th suspected case, and 9 additional, asymptomatic relatives. They had no clinical evidence of associated endocrine lesion suggesting MEN-1 or CNC. Genetic screening for germline mutation of the MEN-1, the gene encoding the protein kinase A (PKA) type 1 alpha regulatory subunit (R1 alpha) (PRKAR1alpha) and AIP gene was negative in 2 affected members. In conclusion, these data suggest that familial pituitary adenomas can occur with a heterogeneous functional pattern that is distinguished from MEN-1 or CNC. The absence of mutation of the recently described AIP gene suggests the implication of other predisposing gene(s). Collaborative, multicentric studies are needed to further define the location of gene(s) involved in heterogeneous FIPA.},

This study aimed to estimate the frequency of MECP2 gene mutations in a large group of mentally retarded patients without FRAXA expansion. Screening by heteroduplex analysis and SSCP followed by DNA sequencing of shifted bands were performed on 613 patients, including 442 males and 171 females. Eleven sequence variants were found, including nine polymorphisms. The two others may be pathogenetic. The first one, the double nucleotide substitution c.1162\_1163delinsTA leading to a premature stop codon (p.Pro388X) was found in a female patient with random X-inactivation, presenting with borderline mental impairment without any features of Rett syndrome. The second one, the c.679C{\textgreater}G substitution, changing a glutamine to a glutamate in the transcriptional repression functional domain (p.Gln227Glu), was found in a female patient with a moderately biased X-chromosome inactivation profile and presenting with mild intellectual delay and minor psychotic features. The low mutation rate suggests that a large-scale routine screening for MECP2 in mentally retarded subjects is not cost-effective in clinical practice. Screening may be improved by a pre-selection based on clinical features that remain to be established.},

MEN-2 is the familial syndrome of medullary thyroid carcinoma, associated with pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism. Apart from the clinical expression of their allelic variants, both syndromes are different in their physiopathogenesis, in that MEN-2 is related to the constitutional activation of the proto-oncogene RET that encodes a putative tyrosine kinase receptor, while MEN-1 is a tumour suppressor gene model, related to mutations in the menin adapter-protein of multiple intracellular functions. The study of other rarer forms of predisposition to endocrine tumours, and especially to hyperparathyroidism, has uncovered new genes such as HRPT2, which show that multiple physiological routes, including the close regulation of transcription and genetic stability, may lead to the same clinical outcome.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the frequency of AIP gene mutations in a large cohort of patients with familial isolated pituitary adenoma (FIPA).
DESIGN: This was a multicenter, international, collaborative study.
SETTING: The study was conducted in 34 university endocrinology and genetics departments in nine countries.
PATIENTS: Affected members from each FIPA family were studied. Relatives of patients with AIP mutations underwent AIP sequence analysis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence/absence and description of AIP gene mutations were the main outcome measures.
INTERVENTION: There was no intervention.
RESULTS: Seventy-three FIPA families were identified, with 156 patients with pituitary adenomas; the FIPA cohort was evenly divided between families with homogeneous and heterogeneous tumor expression. Eleven FIPA families had 10 germline AIP mutations. Nine mutations, R16H, G47\_R54del, Q142X, E174frameshift, Q217X, Q239X, K241E, R271W, and Q285frameshift, have not been described previously. Tumors were significantly larger (P = 0.0005) and diagnosed at a younger age (P = 0.0006) in AIP mutation-positive vs. mutation-negative subjects. Somatotropinomas predominated among FIPA families with AIP mutations, but mixed GH/prolactin-secreting tumors, prolactinomas, and nonsecreting adenomas were also noted. Approximately 85\% of the FIPA cohort and 50\% of those with familial somatotropinomas were negative for AIP mutations.
CONCLUSIONS: AIP mutations, of which nine new mutations have been described here, occur in approximately 15\% of FIPA families. Although pituitary tumors occurring in association with AIP mutations are predominantly somatotropinomas, other tumor types are also seen. Further study of the impact of AIP mutations on protein expression and activity is necessary to elucidate their role in pituitary tumorigenesis in FIPA.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVM), mostly cutaneous and mucous (telangiectases), but also involving the lungs (PAVM), liver (HAVM) and brain (CAVM). We studied the relationship between the phenotype and genotype in patients with a proven mutation in either ENG (HHT1) or ACVRL1 (HHT2).
METHODS: Clinical features and their age of onset were compared between HHT1 and HHT2. The type of mutation was also analyzed. Clinical manifestations were distinguished from lesions found by screening.
RESULTS: Ninety-three HHT1 patients and 250 HHT2 patients were included. Epistaxis occurred later in HHT2, with incomplete penetrance (P{\textless}0.0001). Symptomatic PAVMs were more frequent in HHT1 (34.4 vs. 5.2\%, P{\textless}0.001), as were cerebral abscesses (7.5 vs. 0.8\%, P=0.002). Gastrointestinal bleeding occurred more frequently in HHT2 (16.4 vs. 6.5\%, P=0.017). Symptomatic hepatic involvement was only seen in HHT2 patients. PAVMs were more frequently detected in asymptomatic HHT1 patients (54 vs. 12.8\%, P{\textless}0.0001). PAVMs and HAVMs were often family clustered in HHT1 and HHT2, respectively. Truncating mutations were associated with a higher frequency of epistaxis and telangiectasis, in HHT2.
CONCLUSION: This study shows major differences between HHT1 and HHT2 phenotypes, which should be taken into account for future clinical studies.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Familial pituitary adenomas occur rarely in the absence of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and Carney complex (CNC).
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to characterize the clinical and genealogical features of non-MEN1/CNC familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA).
DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a retrospective study of clinical and genealogical characteristics of FIPA cases and performed a comparison with a sporadic population at 22 university hospitals in Belgium, Italy, France, and The Netherlands.
RESULTS: Sixty-four FIPA families including 138 affected individuals were identified [55 prolactinomas, 47 somatotropinomas, 28 nonsecreting adenomas (NS), and eight ACTH-secreting tumors]. Cases were MEN1/PRKAR1A-mutation negative. First-degree relationships predominated (75.6\%) among affected individuals. A single tumor phenotype occurred in 30 families (homogeneous), and heterogeneous phenotypes occurred in 34 families. FIPA cases were younger at diagnosis than sporadic cases (P = 0.015); tumors were diagnosed earlier in the first vs. the second generation of multigenerational families. Macroadenomas were more frequent in heterogeneous vs. homogeneous FIPA families (P = 0.036). Prolactinomas from heterogeneous families were larger and had more frequent suprasellar extension (P = 0.004) than sporadic cases. Somatotropinomas occurred as isolated familial somatotropinoma cases and within heterogeneous FIPA families; isolated familial somatotropinoma cases represented 18\% of FIPA cases and were younger at diagnosis than patients with sporadic somatotropinomas. Familial NS cases were younger at diagnosis (P = 0.03) and had more frequently invasive tumors (P = 0.024) than sporadic cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Homogeneous and heterogeneous expression of prolactinomas, somatotropinomas, NS, and Cushing's disease can occur within families in the absence of MEN1/CNC. FIPA and sporadic cases have differing clinical characteristics. FIPA may represent a novel endocrine neoplasia classification that requires further genetic characterization.},

	abstract = {Major advances have been made in the understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying endocrine tumorigenesis, through the study of several syndromes of genetic predisposition and the identification of the genes involved. The syndrome of type 1 multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN-1) is one of the best known; this autosomal dominant hereditary syndrome predisposes to the development of endocrine tumors of the pituitary, the parathyroids, the foregut and the adrenals. The responsible gene, known as MEN-1, encodes an original protein, menin, involved in several major cellular functions, such as the control of cell proliferation and differentiation. Type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN-2) is an autosomal dominant hereditary syndrome associated with the development of medullary carcinomas of the thyroid, pheochromocytomas and hyperparathyroidism; the corresponding gene, RET, encodes a transmembrane receptor with tyrosine kinase activity. Endocrine tumors are also associated with non Hippel-Lindau disease and with phacomatoses, such as type 1 neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis. Finally, isolated familial syndromes of endocrine tumors have been described: isolated familial hyperparathyroidism type II (HRPT2), associated with alterations in a gene coding for an original protein, parafibromin, or isolated familial syndromes of pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PRG) associated with mutations in the genes SDHB, SDHC or SDHD, which encode succinate-dehydrogenase subunits. The understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying these syndromes of predisposition is essential for the diagnosis and management of these patients and their family; it also gives insight on the molecular mechanisms of endocrine tumorigenesis.},

	abstract = {Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by arteriovenous malformations and resulting from mutations in two major genes: ENG and ACVRL1. The aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of the mutations of ENG and ACVRL1 in HHT, based on the largest series of patients reported so far, recruited through a national network. We previously reported the first mutation screening of both genes, in French HHT patients, using heteroduplex analysis. This previous study, bringing 60 novel mutations, provided a significant improvement to the knowledge of molecular pathology in HHT. However, 32\% (n=48) of the patients with a confirmed clinical diagnosis remained without mutation. In these patients, we performed an extensive molecular analysis that included the sequencing of the whole coding sequence, the search for large rearrangements, and screening of the potential 5' regulatory regions. Additionally, due to the lack of large pedigrees suitable for linkage analysis, and since SMAD4 germline mutations have been reported in families with combined HHT and juvenile polyposis, we screened this gene and five other genes involved in the TGF-beta/BMP pathway in the patients without mutation of ENG or ACVRL1. Only a novel SMAD1 non-conservative substitution was found in one patient, changing a poorly conserved methionine to an isoleucin. Twenty-three mutations were found in ACVRL1 and 8 in ENG (including a duplication of exons 4 to 8 and deletions of exons 1 to 3 and 9 to 14). Our results, combined with our previous data, increase the mutation rate to 88\% (n=119/136) in French patients with a confirmed clinical diagnosis. Our results also emphasize the higher prevalence of large insertions/deletions in ENG and the predominance of ACVRL1 over ENG mutations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The management of small, nonfunctioning pancreaticoduodenal endocrine tumors (NFPET) in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) patients is still controversial. We therefore investigated the effect of surgery on survival and tumor progression in MEN1 patients with NFPET {\textless} or = 2 cm by analyzing data from the Groupe des Tumeurs Endocrines (GTE) registry.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 579 MEN1 patients in the registry, 65 had NFPET {\textless} or = 2 cm. Fifteen (23\%) underwent pancreatectomy, 9 at least segmental pancreatectomies and 6 biopsies or enucleations (the surgery group), and 50 (77\%) were followed conservatively (the no surgery group). Age at MEN1 and NFPET diagnosis was similar in both groups, as was size of the primary tumor. Seven (10.8\%) patients had metastases. Five metastases were synchronous, and 2 (one in each group) were metachronous. Tumor size was similar in patients with or without metastasis.
RESULTS: There was no perioperative mortality. The average follow-up time after NFPET diagnosis was 6.7 years in the surgery group and 3.3 years in the no surgery group. Three (4.6\%) patients died during follow-up, 2 due to NFPET and 1 due to thymus tumor. The 2 patients who died of NFPET had undergone pancreatic surgery at the time of NFPET diagnosis. The 2 groups did not differ significantly with respect to tumor progression [5/15 (33\%) vs 6/38 (16\%), P = 0.16]. Overall life expectancy of patients with NFPET {\textless} or = 2 cm was not different than that of the 229 MEN1 patients in the registry without any pancreaticoduodenal tumor (P = 0.33).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that surgery may not be beneficial for MEN1 patients with NFPET {\textless} or = 2 cm.},

The use of denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), a high throughput, reliable and automated heteroduplex-based technique, is the ideal for mutation detection in MEN1. In this work, DHPLC was optimised for the screening of the nine coding exons and splice junctions of MEN1. Thanks to collaboration between two French laboratories recognised as reference centres for genotypic MEN1 diagnosis (Lyon and Lille), a blind retrospective study conducted in a cohort of 160 unrelated MEN1 probands with (or without) known germline mutations was undertaken to evaluate the sensitivity of DHPLC. We were able to detect 101 different sequence variations by DHPLC, distributed in the 10 analysed DNA fragments and corresponding to 100\% of mutation detection compared with direct sequencing. 1.2\% of samples were considered as false positive, exhibiting a heterogenous profile. DHPLC did not detect five cases of deletion or duplication of complete exons, neither did direct sequencing, showing the limits of the technique. Nevertheless, the method appeared to allow automated, rapid and low-cost mutation detection with high accuracy. Direct sequencing can be then applied to identify the sequence variations on the targeted DNA fragments showing heterozygous profile by DHPLC. In conclusion, genotypic diagnosis of MEN1 can benefit from DHPLC in terms of efficacy, rapidity and cost.},

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Pancreaticoduodenal tumors develop in a majority of MEN 1 patients and are a major cause of death. The natural history of NFTP is poorly defined, and no clear-cut guidelines have been widely accepted regarding treatment.
METHODS: Data on 108 patients with isolated NFTP among 579 MEN 1 patients from the French Endocrine Tumor Study Group (GTE) were analyzed. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.
RESULTS: The penetrance of NFTP was 34\% at age 50, making it the most frequent pancreaticoduodenal tumor in MEN 1 patients. Forty-three patients (40\%) underwent surgery, 32 of them curatively. No patient died because of surgery. Average life expectancy for patients with NFTP was shorter than that for MEN 1 patients who did not have pancreaticoduodenal tumors. Thirteen patients died during follow-up, 10 due to NFTP. Tumor size was correlated with the risks of metastasis and death. These risks were low for patients with tumors{\textless}or=20 mm.
CONCLUSIONS: NFTP are currently the most common tumors of the pancreaticoduodenal region in patients with MEN 1. Prevention of tumor spread by surgery should be balanced with potential operative mortality and morbidity. We do not recommend routine surgery for NFTP{\textless}or=20 mm.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 26 adults (median age 38.5 years, range 18-80) from two unrelated MEN-1 pedigrees. In 15 of the patients the diagnosis was confirmed by genetic analysis, while in the rest the diagnosis was based on clinical criteria combined with genealogy data.
RESULTS: Urolithiasis associated with primary hyperparathyroidism was present in 65\% of MEN-1 patients and in 77\% of those who were symptomatic. In 68\% of patients complications of urolithiasis (renal/ureteric colic, urinary tract infection) were the presenting clinical manifestations of MEN-1, whereas in 50\% they constituted the only clinical manifestation of the syndrome. The mean time from the onset of symptoms of urolithiasis to the diagnosis of the polyendocrinopathy was 17.2 years. Initial failure to recognize the presence of MEN-1 in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism led to conservative parathyroid surgery, with subsequent relapse of the hyperparathyroidism, requiring re-operation. Serious renal morbidity included one case of pyonephrosis necessitating nephrectomy. While urolithiasis was a cardinal clinical manifestation of MEN-1, there was otherwise considerable phenotypic polymorphism, even among patients bearing the same MEN1 gene mutation.
CONCLUSION: In patients with familial MEN-1 the complications of urolithiasis are the commonest presenting clinical manifestations and the cause of significant morbidity. In the presence of a family history of renal stones, appropriate investigations may lead to the timely diagnosis of this important, albeit rare, disorder.},

METHODS: Records of the patients whose GTE registry codes included glucagonoma, VIPoma or somatostatinoma were reviewed. The diagnosis was confirmed when there were clinical signs of a functioning tumor and/or when blood levels of the peptide were higher than twice the upper limit of normal.
RESULTS: Among 580 patients with MEN 1, duodeno-pancreatic involvement was present in 307 (52.9\%). Five (1.6\%) had a glucagonoma, 3 (0.98\%) a VIPoma and 2 (0.65\%) a somatostatinoma.

Tumor size was greater than 3 cm more often for these rare tumours (67\%) than in patients with other type of duodeno-pancreatic involvement (28\%) (P=0.02) and visceral metastases were more frequent (40\% vs 15\%; P=0.056). Ten-year survival of patients with glucagonomas, VIPomas or somatostatinomas (53.8\%; CI95\%: 15.5-92.1) was poorer than that of patients with insulinomas (91.4\%; CI95\%: 83.399.5; P=0.01) or gastrinomas (81.7\%; CI95\%: 74.9-88.5; P=0.20) and close to that of patients with non-functioning tumors (62.2\%, CI95\%: 41.0-83.9; NS).
CONCLUSION: Glucagonomas, VIPomas and somatostatinomas, especially the functioning type, are very rare in patients with MEN 1. Prognosis is poor, probably because of large tumor size and high rate of metastasis. Survival is similar to that in patients with non-functioning tumors.},

	abstract = {On July 2000, 127 gastrinomas (31.1\%) were studied by the Endocrine Tumour Group (GTE) using a 408-patient cohort of Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 patients. The aim of this study was to assess clinical, biological, surgical data as well as their trends over three periods ({\textless}1980-1980/1989-{\textgreater}1990). A Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (SZE) was present in 96\% of the cases. Mean age at the onset of the disease was 39.4 years. There were 55.9\% of men. Synchronous liver metastasis was present in 7.1\%. Taken independently, the positivity of the four main diagnosis tests decreased over the time. The diagnosis of oesophagitis increased (4.5-29.7\%), as well as the size of the resected tumours (9.9-16.8 mm). There was an increase in the familial background diagnosis (73.1-80\%), an increasing use of Octreoscan scintigraphy and transduodenal ultrasound with positive detection of metastasis and tumours in 81.3\% and 92.3\%, respectively after 1991. Patients were operated on less frequently (96-52.5\%), less frequently from the pancreas (87.5-37.5\%), and from the gastro-intestinal tract (70.8-30\%). The relative percentage of major pancreatic resections increased (with at least removal of the duodenum and the pancreatic head) (10-26.7\%). The operative mortality disappeared. Six out of the seven patients (85.7\%) who benefited from major pancreatic resections normalized their gastrine level postoperatively versus 15\% in less radical techniques. Overall 5 years survival was 90 +/- 4.4\%. Survival increased after 1985 (85 +/- 4.8\% versus 95 +/- 3.6, P = 0.1).
CONCLUSION: SZE in NEM1 were diagnosed at an earlier stage and were less frequently operated on. Nevertheless, the incidence of synchronous metastasis did not change significantly. Patients were mainly operated on for gastric emergencies and pancreatic tumours in order to prevent metastasis without mortality after 1991.},

	abstract = {Menin, the product of the tumor suppressor gene MEN1, is widely expressed in mammalian endocrine and non-endocrine tissues, including intestine. Its known abundant expression in several types of cells with high proliferative capacity led us to investigate the physiological function of the protein menin in intestinal epithelium, one of the most rapidly growing epithelia. Here we showed that the Men1 gene is mainly expressed in the crypt compartment of the proximal small intestine and that its expression was increased during fasting in vivo, both suggesting a role of menin in the control of cell growth. Indeed, specific reduction of menin expression by transfected antisense cDNA in the rat duodenal crypt-like cell line, IEC-17, increased cell proliferation. The latter is correlated to a loss of cell-cycle arrest in G(1) phase by resting cells and an overexpression of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)-4. Furthermore, these cells lost the inhibition of proliferation induced by transforming growth factor-beta1, associated with a decrease of transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor expression. As a result of deregulated proliferation, antisense menin transfected IEC-17 cells became tumorigenic as shown in vitro as well as in vivo in immunosuppressed animals. These results indicate that menin contributes to proliferation control in intestinal epithelial cells. The present study reveals an unknown physiological function for menin in intestine that may be important in the regulation of epithelial homeostasis.},

The disease is caused by mutations of two genes: ENG and ALK1 (ACVRL1). We screened the coding sequence of ENG and ALK1 in 160 unrelated French index cases. A germline mutation was identified in 100 individuals (62.5\%). A total of 36 mutations were found in ENG, including three nonsense mutations, 19 small insertions/deletions leading to a frameshift, two inframe deletions, seven missense mutations, and five intronic or splice-site mutations. Of the 36 mutations, 33 were novel mutations. A total of 64 mutations were found in ALK1, including six nonsense mutations, 28 small insertions/deletions leading to a frameshift, one inframe deletion, 27 missense mutations, and two intronic or splice-site mutations. Of the 64 mutations, 27 were novel mutations. Mutations were found in most parts of the coding sequence for both genes, except ALK1 exon 5 and ENG exons 12 to 14. Missense mutations in ALK1 were more frequent in exons 7, 8, and 10. ENG cDNA was sequenced for three intronic mutations: c.689+2T{\textgreater}C produced an abnormal transcript excluding exon 5, c.1103+3\_1103+8del activated a cryptic splice site 22 bp upstream, and c.1428G{\textgreater}A produced two abnormal transcripts, one including intron 11 and the other excluding exon 10. Although most of the mutations were private, some recurrent mutations in ALK1 were of particular interest. Mutation c.1112\_1113dupG (p.Gly371fsX391) was found in 17 unrelated individuals sharing a common haplotype, strongly suggesting a founder effect related to the concentration of patients previously reported in a specific French region (Rhône-Alpes). Three missense mutations involved the same codon: c.1231C{\textgreater}T (p.Arg411Trp), c.1232G{\textgreater}C (p.Arg411Pro), and c.1232G{\textgreater}A (p.Arg411Gln) were found in seven, two, and one patients, respectively.

	abstract = {Our previous studies on the human MEN1 (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1) gene revealed heterogeneity of MEN1 2.8 kb transcripts related to variation in their 5' UTR only. Six distinct exons 1 (e1A-e1F) were isolated that suggested the existence of multiple but not already identified transcriptional start sites (TSS) and of a complex transcriptional control. Identification of a minimal promoter region and its adjacent regulatory regions appears an inescapable step to the understanding of MEN1 gene transcriptional regulation in normal and pathological situations. For this purpose, we subcloned the approximately 2000 bp region situated directly upstream of the exon 2 in front of a luciferase reporter gene, and we analyzed functional consequences of 5' and 3' serial deletions, comparatively in a series of endocrine versus non-endocrine cell lines. Primer extension and RPA experiments demonstrate that in HEK293 cells transcription initiated simultaneously at several points in endogenous MEN1 promoter as well as in transfected promoter fragments in reporter plasmids, mainly in Inr elements that are efficiently employed to synthetize previously described exons e1A-e1D. Functional consequences of TSS deletion are directly related to cellular context. The minimal promoter region is localized between -135 and -36. Five large adjacent cis-regulatory regions (UR1-UR5) exist upstream of this minimal promoter region, whose activity depend not only on the cellular context but also on the presence of a downstream sequence DR1. Five small cis-regulatory elements (C1-C5) are localized between -325 and -107. Overexpression of exogenous menin, the MEN1 gene's product, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts from Men1(-/-) knock-out mice dose-dependently decreases MEN1 promoter activity, through sequences surrounding the minimal promoter. Our data highlight the existence of a complex transcriptional regulation of the MEN1 gene, whose activity is clearly modulated depending not only on the cellular context but also on menin intracellular levels. They are the molecular bases required for a future understanding of a potential specific transcription control in endocrine cells.},

Forty-three genomic DNA samples were used for the evaluation of these techniques. The whole coding region of MEN1 was PCR-amplified with fluorescent primers and then denatured/renatured before electrophoresis on an automated sequencer. 100\% of the mutations were detected, subsequently confirmed and identified by sequencing. "Negative" samples were used to evaluate the specificity and reproducibility of the two techniques. The combination of the two methods allows high throughput cost-effective mutation screening which is less laborious than systematic sequencing of the whole coding region of MEN1.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: FRAXE is a second locus associated with X chromosome fragility. Similar to FRAXA, the common mutation is a GCC expansion located in the 5' untranslated region, leading to the hypermethylation of the region and to the subsequent inactivation of specific genes (FMR1 and FMR2, respectively). Unlike FRAXA, FRAXE has a rare occurrence and is less currently studied in routine analyses. The phenotype associated with FRAXE is usually considered as mild or moderate mental retardation, with incomplete penetrance. However, phenotype/genotype relations have been less characterized.
OBJECTIVE: We report a French family with three members affected with mental retardation, including a female suffering from West syndrome, and two mentally retarded males.
METHODS: After exclusion of the FRAXA expansion by Southern blot analysis, we performed a karyotype using folate-thymidine-deficient medium and a southern blot to search for FRAXE expansion.
RESULTS: All three mentally retarded patients had a number of repeats over 800 GCC and expressed more than 20\% of fragile sites in their leukocytes. Another carrier female with a full expansion had a subnormal mental impairment.
CONCLUSIONS: Clinical features and both the cytogenetic and molecular findings seem to correlate in this family. We discuss the bias encountered when studying such families and some of the mechanisms that may explain part of the clinical variability.},

The MEN1 gene encodes menin, a nuclear protein interacting with JunD/AP1, Smad3, NFkappaB, and other proteins involved in transcription and cell growth regulation. Here, by exhaustive sequence analysis of 170 probands/families collected through a French clinical network, we identified 165 mutations located in coding parts of the MEN1 gene, which represent 114 distinct MEN1 germline alterations. These mutations have been included in a MEN1-locus specific database available on the world wide web together with approximately 240 germline and somatic MEN1 mutations listed from international published data. Our mutation series included 56 frameshifts, 23 nonsense, 27 missense, and eight deletion or insertion in-frame mutations. Mutations were spread over the entire coding sequence. Taken together, most missense and in-frame MEN1 genomic alterations affect one or all domains of menin interacting with JunD [codons 1-40; 139-242; 323-428], Smad3 [distal to codon 478], and NFkappaB [codons 276-479], three major effectors in transcription and cell growth regulation. No correlation has been observed between genotype and MEN1 phenotype. We suggest that the knowledge of structure and location of a specific mutation has not been useful in clinical practice for the follow-up of affected patients and asymptomatic gene carriers. Our results provide the largest series of MEN1 mutations published to date. They will be a useful tool for further studies focusing on the functional effects of missense mutations and understanding which mechanisms or pathways related to multiple menin interactions might be involved in tumorigenesis of endocrine cells.},

We analyzed the data of a large series of 324 MEN1 patients from a French and Belgian multicenter study. Data on pituitary disease were compared with those from 110 non-MEN1 patients with pituitary adenomas, matched for age, year of diagnosis, and follow-up period. Genetic analysis of the MEN1 gene was performed in 197 of the MEN1 patients. In our MEN1 series, pituitary disease occurred in 136 of 324 (42\%), less frequently than hyperparathyroidism (95\%, P {\textless} 0.001) and endocrine enteropancreatic tumors (54\%, P {\textless} 0.01). Mean age of onset of pituitary tumors was 38.0+/-15.3 yr (range, 12-83 yr). Pituitary disease was associated with hyperparathyroidism in 90\% of cases, with enteropancreatic tumors in 47\%, with adrenal tumors in 16\%, and with thoracic neuroendocrine tumors in 4\%. Pituitary disease was the initial lesion of MEN1 in 17\% of all MEN1 patients. MEN1 pituitary adenomas were significantly more frequent in women than in men (50\% vs. 31\%, P {\textless} 0.001). Among the 136 pituitary adenomas, there were 85 prolactinomas and 12 GH-secreting, 6 ACTH-secreting, 13 cosecreting, and 20 nonsecreting tumors. Eighty-five percent of MEN1-related pituitary lesions were macroadenomas (vs. 42\% in non-MEN1 patients, P {\textless} 0.001), including 32\% of invasive cases. Among secreting adenomas, hormonal hypersecretion was normalized, after treatment, in only 42\% (vs. 90\% in non-MEN1 patients, P {\textless} 0.001), with a median follow-up of 11.4 yr. No correlation was found between the type of MEN1 germ-line mutation and the presence or absence of pituitary adenoma. Our study, based on a large group of MEN1 patients, shows that pituitary adenomas occur in 42\% of the cases and are characterized by a larger size and a more aggressive presentation than without MEN1.},

Carney and uncommonly Recklinghausen and Tuberous Sclerosis syndromes represent almost the whole panel of genetic diseases for which genes have been cloned and most of the functional knowledge has been collected. All the endocrine glands are concerned in these diseases, but the cellular pathways that are deregulated downstream from the deleterious mutations occurring in the genes of these autosomal dominant syndromes. might be related to each step of the cell life, from mitosis to DNA transcription, membrane receptor signalling and growth factor production, protein catabolism and extracellular matrix synthesis, and from transcription regulation to apoptosis and response to hypoxia and cellular stress. Here, we present an overview of genes involved in genetic predisposition to neuroendocrine tumors and highlight the complexity of pathways involved and the need of further studies focussing on genes involved in tumoral progression, most neuroendocrine tumors being benign at initial diagnosis but able to produce highly malignant cellular clones related to secondary genetic alterations or deregulation of growth factor production or cell cell adhesion processes.},

The patients were retrieved through the GENEM network from various Belgian and French institutions with the help of genetics laboratories. Among the 245 pHPT patients (96\%), 42\% were men. The mean age at the time of diagnosis was 39.5 +/- 13.3 years. Trends were studied for three periods: before 1986, from 1986 to 1990, and thereafter. After 1990 MEN-I patients were more often diagnosed with isolated pHPT (8\%, 11\%, 28\%, for the three periods, respectively; p = 0.002); it was seen more often in screened patients (31\%, 28\%, 53\%; p = 0.001), more often among those in already known MEN-I families (64\%, 45\%, 72\%; p = 0.005), and among those with lower preoperative calcemia (2.93, 2.87, 2.79 mmol/L; p = 0.001). The age at pHPT diagnosis remained constant throughout the study. The percentage of cervical explorations dropped during the entire study (87\%, 87\%, 53\%; p {\textless} 0.0001). After 1985 the percentage of subtotal parathyroidectomies increased (25\%, 59\%, 51\%; p = 0.0004). Pathology disclosed more hyperplasias (59\%, 85\%, 74\%; p = 0.008).

This is the first multicentric study on the management of MEN-I-related pHPT. Immediate postoperative hHPT cure increased, but only 80\% of the operated patients were cured after 1990. Fifteen percent were hypocalcemic. Because MEN-I-related hHPT cure remains difficult to achieve, we advocate that subtotal parathyroidectomies be performed in specialized centers.},

Three patients had lymph node metastases at the time of diagnosis. One patient is dead with metastatic dissemination. The others are alive without recurrence or metastasis.

MEN-1 mutation in this family was shown as a frameshift (1607delA) in exon 10. To assess the role of the MEN-1 gene in the pathogenesis of tumours less commonly associated with MEN-1, we studied GIST DNA for loss of the unaffected MEN-1 gene allele. Stromal tumour and peripheral leucocyte DNAs from our patient were examined for loss of heterozygosity using the PYGM microsatellite polymorphism and an intragenic polymorphism (D418D in exon 9) in the MEN-1 gene. We showed no evidence for loss of the wild-type MEN-1 allele in GIST. The MEN-1 germline inactivating mutation 1607delA-ter558 in exon 10 was detected in the stromal tumour DNA, but no somatic mutation in the wild-type MEN-1 allele in GIST DNA was detected. Occurrence of GIST could be consistent with the possibility that this MEN-1-related uncommon neoplasm arose independently by a mechanism unrelated to the MEN-1 gene.},

	abstract = {STUDY AIM: The aim of this retrospective study conducted by the "Groupe d'étude des néoplasies endocriniennes multiples type 1" (GENEM) was to report a series of insulinomas associated with multiple endocrine neoplasias type 1 (NEM 1) and to determine the most appropriate strategy for the topographical exploration and surgical management.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1960 to 1996, 44 patients were included, 16 men and 28 women (mean age: 36.4 +/- 13.9 years). This study concerned morphological investigations, tumoral features, modalities and results of the treatment.
RESULTS: Insulinomas were associated with other functional islet tumors in 15 patients: ZE syndrome (n = 8), glucagonoma (n = 6), vipoma (n = 1). Malignant lesions were present in 6 patients: isolated insulinomas (n = 2), insulinomas associated with ZE syndrome (n = 2) and vipoma (n = 1). The sensitivity of the preoperative imaging procedures was less than 70\%. Fourty-one patients were operated on: subtotal pancreatectomy (n = 26 including cephalic enucleations in 8), enucleations (n = 8), total pancreatectomy (n = 3), pancreaticoduodenectomy with caudal enucleations (n = 1), and for 3 patients, no details were available. There was no postoperative mortality. Hyperinsulinism disappeared in 27 patients (including 2 after reoperation) with a mean follow-up of 9 years. Among 6 patients with malignant lesions, 3 were alive with a 3, 4 and 10 year-follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Subtotal pancreatectomy with splenic conservation and enucleation of cephalic lesions is suggested as the procedure of choice in this group of patients. This procedure allows simplification of preoperative imaging investigations because lesions of the pancreatic head have only to be detected. Preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography and intraoperative ultrasonography are the best investigations.},

	abstract = {Through insights into the molecular genetics of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), the genes predisposing to multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes were identified. In MEN1, tumors occur in the parathyroids, endocrine pancreas, anterior pituitary, adrenal glands and thymic neuroendocrine tissues. The MEN1 gene encodes a putative growth-suppressor protein, menin, binding JunD, a transcriptional factor belonging to the AP-1 complex. However, new partners binding menin remain to be found. The MEN1 gene might be involved in 1-50\% of sporadic NETs. Another critical mechanism involved in NETs is the deregulation of the RET-signalling pathways by oncogenic point mutations responsible for MEN2 syndromes. MEN2 refers to the inherited forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma. The RET proto-oncogene, a tyrosine-kinase receptor, is activated by missense mutations occurring either in the extracellular dimerization domain or intracellular tyrosine kinase catalytic regions. In both cases the receptor is constitutionally activated in the absence of natural ligands. Endocrine tumors also belong to the clinical pattern of Recklinghausen (NF1) and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) diseases. The genes for both syndromes have been characterized and provide new pathways for endocrine tumorigenesis related to G-protein physiology (NF1) and transcriptional regulation and/or endothelial cell proliferation (VHL), respectively. Here, we propose a basic overview of recent data on genetic events leading a normal endocrine cell towards a fully malignant phenotype.},

However, tumors of mesenchymal origin such as angiofibroma and collagenoma of the skin have also been associated with the syndrome. This highlights the possibility of an association between MEN 1 and some other types of tumors. Here we report 7 cases of primary malignant melanoma occurring in 7 MEN 1 families, all patients exhibiting classic features of MEN 1. Based on these findings and the previous implication of multiple melanoma tumor suppressor(s) in 11q, including the MEN1 region, we have investigated the involvement of the MEN1 gene in melanoma tumorigenesis. Mutation analysis was performed on a panel of 39 sporadic metastatic melanomas, 13 melanoma cell lines and 20 melanoma families without CDKN2A or CDK4 germline mutations. In addition, 19 sporadic metastatic tumors were screened for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 11q13. LOH was detected in 6 tumors (32\%), and in 4 of the tumors the pattern of LOH suggested that the deletion included the MEN1 gene locus. A novel somatic nonsense mutation in exon 7 (Q349X) was identified in 1 sporadic tumor which also showed loss of the wild-type allele. We conclude that the MEN1 gene plays a role in the tumorigenesis of a small subgroup of melanoma.},

Reproducible bands other than 68 kDa were observed in adrenal and heart, whereas menin was undetectable in liver, lung, pancreas and skin. Analysis of synchronized HeLa cells revealed no variation in the amount or size of menin throughout the cell cycle. Protein expression was compared between lymphoblastoid cell lines from healthy controls and MEN1 patients carrying nonsense mutations on 1 allele. No truncated protein was detected in either cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions in mutation-carrying cells. The expression level and cellular location of full-length menin did not differ between cell lines derived from MEN1 patients and healthy donors.

	abstract = {Familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A syndromes are dominantly inherited diseases caused by activating germline mutations of the RET protooncogene. The majority of these patients carry a germline point mutation affecting one of five cysteine residues encoded by exon 10 (codon 609, 611, 618, or 620) or 11 (codon 634). In a few FMTC families, point mutations involving noncysteine codons in exon 13 (codons 768, 790, and 791), 14 (codon 804), or 15 (codon 891) have been reported. Hirschsprung's disease is a nonneoplastic disorder associated with RET mutations leading to a loss of function effect. Mutations are identified in 50\% of the familial cases and are scattered along the gene. We now report the study of a FMTC family with four affected members and a history of fatal neonatal intestinal obstruction in the sister of the proband. Genetic analysis demonstrated the absence of an usual FMTC mutation and the presence of a germline 9-bp duplication in RET exon 8 in the heterozygous state in all patients with MTC. This new mutation creates an additional cysteine residue in the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of RET. Further studies are warranted to confirm whether this new mutation is causing MTC only or could be associated with Hirschsprung's disease.},

Minor lesions have been observed in MEN1 patients such as cutaneous tumors (angiofibroma, lipoma, lentiginosis), thyroid epithelioma and tumors of the central nervous system, mainly spinal ependymoma. The MEN1 gene, a locus encompassing a 9 kb of genomic sequence contains 10 exons, the first exon being untranslated. The protein encoded by this gene was called menin and has been shown to contain two nuclear localization signals (NLS), suggesting a major function in the nucleus. Germline MEN1 mutations have been described in more than 150 families and are spread throughout the entire coding sequence. More than 70\% of the mutations alter one or both NLS and no genotype-phenotype correlations were found to date. The MEN1 gene seems to be involved in a 20-30\% of sporadic parathyroid and pancreatic/bronchic neuroendocrine tumors, but less than 1\% of pituitary sporadic tumors. Further knowledge on the intracellular function of menin will be needed to understand the pathogenic effect of truncating and missense mutations of this gene in the initiation of endocrine cells tumorigenesis.},

	abstract = {The gene responsible for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), a heritable predisposition to endocrine tumours in man, has recently been identified. Here we have characterized the murine homologue with regard to cDNA sequence, genomic structure, expression pattern and chromosomal localisation. The murine Men1 gene spans approximately 6.7 kb of genomic DNA and is comprised of 10 exons with similar genomic structure to the human locus. It was mapped to the pericentromeric region of mouse chromosome 19, which is conserved with the human 11q13 band where MEN1 is located. The predicted protein is 611 amino acids in length and overall is 97\% homologous to the human orthologue. The 45 reported MEN1 mutations which alter or delete a single amino acid in human all occur at conserved residues, thereby supporting their functional significance. Two transcripts of approximately 3.2 and 2.8 kb were detected in both embryonal and adult murine tissues, resulting from alternative splicing of intron 1. By RNA in situ hybridization and Northern analysis the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Men1 was determined during mouse development. Men1 gene activity was detected already at gestational day 7. At embryonic day 14 expression was generally high throughout the embryo, while at day 17 the thymus, skeletal muscle, and CNS showed the strongest signal. In selected tissues from postnatal mouse Men1 was detected in all tissues analysed and was expressed at high levels in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, testis, and thymus. In brain the menin protein was detected mainly in nerve cell nuclei, whereas in testis it appeared perinuclear in spermatogonia. These results show that Men1 expression is not confined to organs affected in MEN1, suggesting that Men1 has a significant function in many different cell types including the CNS and testis.},

In this study, a total of 84 families and/or isolated patients with either MEN1 or MEN1-related inherited endocrine tumors were screened for MEN1 germ-line mutations, by heteroduplex and sequence analysis of the MEN1 gene-coding region and untranslated exon 1. Germ-line MEN1 alterations were identified in 47/54 (87\%) MEN1 families, in 9/11 (82\%) isolated MEN1 patients, and in only 6/19 (31.5\%) atypical MEN1-related inherited cases. We characterized 52 distinct mutations in a total of 62 MEN1 germ-line alterations. Thirty-five of the 52 mutations were frameshifts and nonsense mutations predicted to encode for a truncated MEN1 protein. We identified eight missense mutations and five in-frame deletions over the entire coding sequence. Six mutations were observed more than once in familial MEN1. Haplotype analysis in families with identical mutations indicate that these occurrences reflected mainly independent mutational events. No MEN1 germ-line mutations were found in 7/54 (13\%) MEN1 families, in 2/11 (18\%) isolated MEN1 cases, in 13/19 (68. 5\%) MEN1-related cases, and in a kindred with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism.

This distribution did not alter upon apoptosis induction by IL-3 deprivation. As an approach to investigate its role in development, we determined the spatio-temporal expression pattern in the mouse. Expression was detected in various tissues in earlier gestational age; however, confined to testes, spleen, thymus, and part of the hippocampus in the adult mouse. The expression profile is consistent with a functional role during rapid growth and cell turnover, and in agreement with a regulatory function for hematopoietic cells. The human cDNA clone sequenced showed high homology to its murine counterpart and extended the open reading frame by 20 codons upstream. The gene is located in the proximal region of mouse Chromosome (Chr) 19. In the homologous human region at 11q13, it is located at about 150 kb centromeric from MLK3.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical, pathologic, and genetic features of thymic carcinoids in the setting of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) and to study means for detection and prevention of this tumor in patients with MEN1.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Thymic carcinoid is a rare malignancy, with approximately 150 cases reported to date. It may be associated with MEN1 and carries a poor prognosis, with no effective treatment. Its underlying etiology is unknown.
METHODS: Ten patients with MEN1 from eight families with anterior mediastinal tumors were included in a case series study at tertiary referring hospitals. Clinicopathologic studies were done on these patients, with a review of the literature. Mutation analysis was performed on the MEN1 gene in families with clusterings of the tumor to look for genotype-phenotype correlation. Loss of heterozygosity was studied in seven cases to look for genetic abnormalities.
RESULTS: Histologic studies of all tumors were consistent with the diagnosis of thymic carcinoid. Clustering of this tumor was found in some of the families-three pairs of brothers and three families with first- or second-degree relatives who had thymic carcinoid. All patients described here were men, with a mean age at detection of 44 years (range 31 to 66). Most of the patients had chest pain or were asymptomatic; none had Cushing's or carcinoid syndrome. All tumors were detected by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest. The results of octreoscans performed in three patients were all positive. Histopathologic studies were consistent with the diagnosis of thymic carcinoid and did not stain for ACTH. Mutation analysis of the families with clustering revealed mutations in different exons/introns of the MEN1 gene. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies of seven tumors did not show LOH in the MEN1 region, but two tumors showed LOH in the 1p region.
CONCLUSIONS: MEN1-related thymic carcinoids constitute approximately 25\% of all cases of thymic carcinoids. In patients with MEN1, this is an insidious tumor not associated with Cushing's or carcinoid syndrome. Local invasion, recurrence, and distant metastasis are common, with no known effective treatment. We propose that CT or MRI of the chest, as well as octreoscanning, should be considered as part of clinical screening in patients with MEN1. We also propose performing prophylactic thymectomy during subtotal or total parathyroidectomy on patients with MEN1 to reduce the risks of thymic carcinoid and recurrence of hyperparathyroidism. Its male predominance, the absence of LOH in the MEN1 region, clustering in close relatives, and the presence of different MEN1 mutations in these families suggest the involvement of modifying genes in addition to the MEN1 gene. A putative tumor suppressor gene in 1p may be involved.},

	abstract = {Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) syndromes are inherited diseases characterised by endocrine tumours occuring as autosomal dominant genetic diseases with high penetrance. In MEN1, most tumours affect the parathyroids, endocrine pancreas, anterior pituitary, and adrenal glands. The MEN1 gene has been cloned recently and encodes a nuclear protein without known function so far. More than 200 germline mutations have been identified in MEN1 patients throughout the entire coding sequence and no genotype-phenotype correlation has been found. Now, MEN1 gene screening is a powerful tool in pre-symptomatic diagnosis for MEN1 patients and those with inherited MEN1 related syndromes. MEN2 refers to the inherited forms of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) which is associated with phaechromocytoma and parathyroid tumours in MEN2A, phaechromocytoma and mucosal neuromas in MEN2B. Familial isolated MTC is characterised by MTC only, and the three variants of MEN2 are related to germline missense mutations of the RET proto-oncogene, which encodes a tyrosine-kinase receptor. Germline RET mutations in MEN2 patients are related to the two main functionnal domains in the RET protein, the extracellular ligand binding domain (MEN2A and FMTC) and the intracellular catalytic domain (MEN2A, MEN2B and FMTC). Genotype-phenotype correlations have been established but must be used carefully in clinical practice. RET mutation analysis is now available for patients and prophylactic thyroidectomy in gene-carriers could be the most reliable way to cure the patients. Mechanisms of tumourigenesis induced by MEN2-related RET germline mutations have been analysed by in vitro studies and the generation of transgenic mice which develop true bilateral MTC. Recent insights on MEN syndrome pathogenesis and related inherited endocrine disorders have a major clinical impact and fundamental studies are now in progress in order to identify all genetic events leading from a normal endocrine tissue towards a fully malignant phenotype.},

No significant homology with known proteins could be found through database screening.

In the second and third generations, two deceased obligate gene carriers died at the ages of 85 and 76 without the history of MEN1, whereas two other living gene carriers above the age of 65 have had no clinical evidence of MEN1 to date. In the fourth generation, eight members were affected, with four having severe MEN1-related and atypical malignancies: a case of metastatic endocrine pancreatic tumor, two cases of metastatic thymic carcinoids, and a case of spinal ependymoma. In the fifth generation, all five patients were below the age of 22 when the disease was detected. MEN1 was confirmed in the family by linkage analysis using MEN1-linked microsatellite markers and by identification of a nonsense mutation in the MEN1/menin gene. Alleotyping showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) involving the wild-type alleles in seven tumors in the family including the ependymoma, which is the first MEN1-related case that shows genetic abnormality in chromosome 11q13, suggesting that MEN1 gene might be involved in the tumorigenesis of a subset of ependymomas. In relation to clinical anticipation, repeated expansion studies were carried out but failed to detect any expansion. We conclude that this is a unique MEN1 family and that an unknown genetic mechanism might be contributing to the anticipation phenomenon. We demonstrate in this family that all gene carriers, including the very young members, will need close and careful follow-up.},

We have searched for mutations in the PP2A-B56 beta coding region, together with the 5' and 3' untranslated regions in six MEN1 patients. DNA sequence abnormalities were not identified and thus the PP2A-B56 beta gene is excluded as the candidate gene for MEN1.

We have pursued studies to facilitate identification of the MEN1 gene by narrowing this critical region to a 900-kb interval between the VRF and D11S1783 loci through melotic mapping. This was achieved by investigating 17 cosmids for microsatellite polymorphisms, which defined two novel polymorphisms at the VRF and A0138 loci, and utilizing these to characterize recombinants in MEN1 families. In addition, we have established a 1200-kb sequence-ready contig consisting of 26 cosmids, eight BACs, and eight PACs that encompass this region. The precise locations for 19 genes and three ESTs within this contig have been determined, and three gene clusters consisting of a centromeric group (VRF, FKBP2, PNG, and PLCB3), a middle group (PYGM, ZFM1, SCG1, SCG2 (which proved to be the MEN1 gene), and PPP2R5B), and a telomeric group (H4B, ANG3, ANG2, ANG1, FON, FAU, NOF, NON, and D11S2196E) were observed.

Mutational analysis of SCG2 in 10 unrelated MEN1 families identified one polymorphism and nine different heterozygous mutations (one missense, four non-sense, one insertional and three deletional frameshifts) that segregated with the disease, hence providing an independent confirmation for the identification of the MEN1 gene.},

Although these families have a clinical presentation distinct from that of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1), the question of this syndrome as being linked to the MEN-1 locus has remained open. Our aim was to study a three-generation family with cases of acromegaly in a mother and her son, to explore better the clinical presentation of the disease, its pattern of inheritance and to test the hypothesis of a genetic linkage to the MEN-1 locus using closely linked polymorphic genetic markers. The refined analysis of 15 unaffected relatives revealed miscellaneous non-specific endocrine dysfunctions and the presence of multiple lipomata, as noted previously in some cases. Moreover, the notion of acromegalo-gigantism in the maternal grandmother and an incomplete penetrance appeared even more typical, suggesting that familial acromegaly is a specific clinical entity. Finally, under the hypotheses assumed for segregation analysis, no clinical, biological or genetic evidence of linkage to the MEN-1 locus could be retained in this family. However, these conclusions were limited because of incomplete penetrance and uncertain definition of the carrier status. Therefore, we conclude that further identification of the genetic predisposition to familial acromegaly might be obtained from the combined molecular genetic analysis of several families presenting with the same clinical features.},

The first aim of physicians is to recognize the syndrome and to determine the appropriate screening especially into two circumstances: 1 degree In case of isolated and sporadic glandular disease -i-e-parathyroid glands, endocrine pancreas, antehypophysis, adrenal glands and neuroendocrine tumors? 2 degrees In case of very high probability of NEM 1 syndrome? This paper answers these two questions, based on the analysis of the first 150 cases collected by the GENEM 1.},

Germ-line mutations were identified in 93\% of the MEN 2A families and 67\% of the FMTC families tested. All were missense mutations affecting one of three cysteines in the extracellular domain of the RET tyrosine kinase receptor. The prevalence of phaeochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism was significantly higher in families with a mutation of cysteine 634. These data confirm the preferential localisation of MEN 2A and FMTC associated mutations and the strong correlation between clinical manifestations and the position of RET mutation.

The elucidation of the mechanisms by which EBV de-regulates B-cell proliferation in vitro will permit an understanding of how the virus contributes in vivo to the genesis of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and of lymphoproliferations in immunosuppressed patients. At present, no single EBV immortalizing gene has been identified, and the hypothesis has been made that many viral genes cooperate in establishing an autocrine loop of secretion leading to immortalization. Constitutive expression of B-cell surface molecules such as CD21 and CD23, specifically implicated in the control of B-cell proliferation, is indeed induced at the surface of immortalized B lymphocytes. The expression of the viral nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) has been shown to be in part responsible for CD21 and CD23 up-regulation, and EBNA2 is suspected to be a transactivator of cellular genes, although this point remains to be demonstrated. The role of EBNA2 gene, independently of other viral genes, has been investigated by transfection into B-lymphoma lines, but conflicting results have been reported. To further investigate its role in the regulation of CD21 and CD23 molecules, we have compared the effects of EBNA2 expression in 2 sets of B-lymphoma lines infected with P3HR1 EBV strain, and/or transfected with EBNA2 gene. We report here that: (i) EBNA2 expression is not a sufficient condition to induce CD21 and CD23 upregulation, EBNA2's effects are highly dependent on the cellular context, and moreover can be modified by infection with P3HR1 virus; (ii) EBNA2 induces activation of CD23 expression in a very particular way, namely, an increased quantity of CD23 steady-state RNA coding for the form A of the protein, which is not detectable at the cell surface but directly secreted.},

	abstract = {In vivo, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with human tumours and with lymphoproliferations in immunosuppressed patients. In vitro, EBV induces unlimited growth of normal B-lymphocytes, a phenomenon known as immortalization. A limited number of viral genes is expressed during this phenomenon and their relative role concerning the deregulation of cellular proliferation is still unclear. At present, the nuclear antigen EBNA2 and the membrane protein LMP are the two EBV proteins considered to be implicated in the immortalization process. Moreover, many data support the hypothesis that EBNA2 is the major inducer of LMP expression by transactivation; however, in some instances, expression of the two proteins is not correlated, suggesting the existence of complex interactions between EBV and its host-cell that influence viral gene regulation. In an attempt to study thoroughly these EBNA2/LMP interactions, it is important to evaluate whether EBNA2 is or is not a major inducer of LMP expression, and which other parameters can influence LMP expression. By analysing two sets of B-lymphoma lines either infected in vitro with EBV or stably transfected with EBNA2, we have demonstrated that (1) LMP expression can be absolutely independent of EBNA2 expression, (2) the level of LMP expression is very tightly regulated, and is independent of EBV genome status (integrated or episomal) and copy number. Our findings provide compelling evidence that LMP expression has to be related to that of cellular factors that remain to be identified.},

APO-1 was not expressed in EBV-negative cell lines and in EBV-positive BL cell lines with a phenotype corresponding to BL tumor biopsy cells (CD10+, CD21-, CD23-, CD30-, CD39-, CDw70-, CD77+). Accordingly, fresh BL cells obtained from three BL biopsies were APO-1 negative. EBV-positive BL cell lines that had acquired a lymphoblastoid phenotype (CD10-, CD21+, CD23+, CD30+, CD39+, CDw70+, CD77-) upon prolonged in vitro cultivation, as well as normal B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, expressed a high density of APO-1. APO-1 may, therefore, be regarded as a B-cell activation marker. APO-1 expression is not the only prerequisite for anti-APO-1-induced apoptosis because 6 of 7 APO-1-expressing EBV-positive BL cell lines were not sensitive to anti-APO-1, whereas all lymphoblastoid cell lines were killed by anti-APO-1. The sensitivity of lymphoblastoid cell lines to anti-APO-1-mediated apoptosis may open a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of EBV-induced lymphoproliferative lesions in immunocompromised individuals, because these are composed of cells with a lymphoblastoid phenotype.},

A TP1 cDNA probe spanning the boundary between exons 1 and 2 and discriminating between TP1 and TP2 transcripts was used for S1 analysis. TP RNA expression varied widely in Burkitt's lymphoma cells. TP-specific transcripts were not detectable or only hardly detectable in Burkitt's lymphoma cells with the group I phenotype (CD10+ CD77+ CD21- CD23- CD30- CDw70-) as well as in P3HR1 virus-converted Burkitt's lymphoma lines.

Membrane expression of decay-accelerating factor (DAF), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), complement receptors (CR)1, CR2 and H was measured either by radioimmunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on cell lysates. Soluble extracts of isolated membranes were tested functionally for their ability to accelerate the decay of C3bBb C3-convertase and allow the cleavage of C3b by factor I. Both regulatory functions were detected in solubilized membranes of Ramos cells, which do not activate the AP, as well as on the potent AP activator, Raji. Raji cells were found to express CR2, DAF and MCP molecules, while MCP was the only known regulatory protein detected on Ramos cells which expressed neither CR1, nor CR2, H or DAF. The I-cofactor activity of both Raji and Ramos cells was immunoprecipitated by anti-MCP, but the decay-accelerating activity was not adsorbed by anti-DAF nor by any of the available antibodies. Two EBV genome-negative cell lines (BJAB, BL41) were tested before and after in vitro conversion by EBV. As previously shown, EBV-converted cell lines activate the AP more efficiently than EBV- cell lines. At the same time, EBV superinfection induces an increase of both AP regulatory functions of cell membranes and enhances the expression of DAF, MCP and CR2. The results of this study show that complement activation by lymphoid cell lines is not related to an impaired autologous control of these cells, but that the expression of regulatory molecules increases together with the appearance of activating structures on the cell surface. Our results also suggest the occurrence of a new factor involved in the decay-accelerating activity on BL lines.},

	abstract = {In vitro infection of EBV-negative lymphoma cell lines with immortalizing strains of Epstein-Barr virus induces the cell-surface expression of B-cell markers, such as the EBV receptor/CR2 (CD21) and the CD23 antigen. The non-immortalizing EBV variant, P3HRI, which carries a deletion encompassing the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) gene, fails to induce any such expression. We show here that the EBV-mediated up-regulation of cell-surface expression of these molecules is associated with an increased level of the specific steady-state RNA corresponding to these 2 genes. These results suggest that the role of EBNA2 in B-cell growth and immortalization may be related to its role in transactivation of cellular genes. In order to identify other cellular genes whose expression may be modulated by EBV, we analyzed the level of transcription of a set of genes possibly involved in Burkitt's lymphoma pathogenesis. The level of the c-myc oncogene transcript was not significantly affected by in vitro EBV infection. The c-fgr oncogene, thought to be specifically activated in EBV-infected cells, was found to be expressed in some EBV-negative lymphoma cells and also to be activated by both non-immortalizing and immortalizing strains of EBV. The expression of vimentin, the major 56-kDa polypeptide of mesenchymal cell intermediate filaments, was altered by all EBV isolates, in either a negative or a positive way, depending on the cell line. Expression of lymphocyte-function-associated antigens, LFA-1 alpha/beta (CD11 a/18) and LFA-3 (CD58), involved in intercellular adhesion and the T-cytotoxic pathway, were differentially regulated by EBV; a crucial observation was the activation by immortalizing EBV isolates of LFA-1 beta chain (CD18) and of LFA-3 (CD58). The EBV-and possibly EBNA2-associated modulation of cellular genes, such as CR2 (CD21), CD23 and LFAs, probably represents key events for EBV-induced B-cell proliferation, and also for in vivo immune control of EBV-infected B cells.},

	abstract = {Lymphocyte function-associated antigens 1 and 3 (LFA-1, LFA-3) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) are cell surface adhesion molecules necessary for immune processes requiring intercellular contact. It was recently proposed that malignant Burkitt's lymphoma cells (BL) may escape from immunosurveillance through the downregulation of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) or LFA-3 (CD58) and ICAM-1 (CD54) molecules. Expression of these three adhesion antigens was investigated in 19 BL lines. LFA-1 or LFA-3 expression was found to be absent or low in 8 of 11 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome positive BL, but strongly expressed on all nonmalignant EBV genome positive lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). Negative or weak expression of LFA-1 and LFA-3 was also observed in 7 of 8 EBV genome negative BL. ICAM-1 was found to be expressed on the cell surface of the majority of BL lines. BL lines growing as individual cells did not express LFA-1, whereas clump-forming BL lines expressed this marker involved in B-cell homotypic aggregation. Expression of LFA-1 and LFA-3 was induced on in vitro infection of EBV-negative BL cells with the immortalizing EBV strain B95-8, and weakly with the nonimmortalizing EBV strain P3HR1. EBNA2 and LMP, two EBV encoded proteins expressed in LCL and in BL infected with B95-8 (BL/B95-8), are not expressed in P3HR1 infected BL cells (BL/P3HR1). Stable expression of EBNA2 after gene transfer in a BL/P3HR1 cell line did not restore the level of LFA-1 and LFA-3 found on BL/B95-8 cells. In EBV-positive BL cells expressing LFA-1 and LFA-3, LMP was found coexpressed, supporting the recent finding of the role of LMP in B-cell adhesion receptor activation. Consequently, diminished LFA-1 and LFA-3 expression appears to be a common characteristic of numerous EBV-positive BL as well as EBV-negative BL. These findings are discussed in the framework of BL pathogenesis.},

This up regulation may represent one of the mechanisms involved in EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization. The P3HR1 nonimmortalizing strain of the virus, which is deleted for the entire Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) protein open reading frame, is incapable of inducing the expression of CR2 and CD23, suggesting a crucial role for EBNA2 in the activation of these molecules. In addition, lymphoma cells containing the P3HR1 genome (BL/P3HR1 cells) do not express the viral latent membrane protein (LMP), which is regularly expressed in cells infected with immortalizing viral strains. Using electroporation, we have transfected the EBNA2 gene cloned in an episomal vector into BL/P3HR1 cells and have obtained cell clones that stably express the EBNA2 protein. In these clones, EBNA2 expression was associated with an increased amount of CR2 and CD23 steady-state RNAs. Of the three species of CD23 mRNAs described, the Fc epsilon RIIa species was preferentially expressed in these EBNA2-expressing clones. An increased cell surface expression of CR2 but not of CD23 was observed, and the soluble form of CD23 molecule (SCD23) was released. We were, however, not able to detect any expression of LMP in these cell clones. These data demonstrate that EBNA2 gene is able to complement P3HR1 virus latent functions to induce the activation of CR2 and CD23 expression, and they emphasize the role of EBNA2 protein in the modulation of cellular gene implicated in B-cell proliferation and hence in EBV-mediated B-cell immortalization. Nevertheless, EBNA2 expression in BL/P3HR1 cells is not able to restore the level of CR2 and CD23 expression observed in BL/B95 cells, suggesting that other cellular or viral proteins may also have an important role in the activation of these molecules: the viral LMP seems to be a good candidate.},

To analyze EBV and C3d binding to this receptor, mouse fibroblasts were transfected with human genomic DNA and rare CD21-positive cells were selected and cloned by cell sorting. The presence of the human gene in host cell DNA as well as its transcription product were assayed with a cloned EBVR/CR2 cDNA by Southern and Northern blotting analysis, respectively. A glycoprotein of apparent molecular mass of 140 kDa, similar to that found in human B lymphocytes, was immunoprecipitated with anti-CD21 mAb and proved to be functional since both C3d and EBV bound efficiently and specifically to mouse cells expressing EBVR/CR2. However, no expression of EBV nuclear antigens, early antigens and viral capsid antigens was detected in cells exposed to EBV. This indicates that the presence of EBVR/CR2 is not sufficient to allow full infection of mouse fibroblasts.},

One of them has enhancer properties. To define more precisely the functional region(s) in the DR enhancer, we generated 5' and 3' deletion mutants. These deletion mutants, which were transfected into various recipient cells of different origins, allowed us to identify two functionally distinct domains, A and B. Domain A was constitutively active in all cell lines tested, except in lymphoid B cells. Domain B was active in lymphoid B cells, and its activity required both EB1 (the BZLF1-encoded EBV trans-acting factor) and the presence of the EBV genome. This suggested that an EBV-encoded, EB1-inducible factor was activating the enhancer B domain. In effect, the B domain was trans-activated by R, an EBV early product encoded by the open reading frame BRLF1, and the activation by R occurred in epithelial, fibroblastic, and lymphoid cells. The R-responsive element has been reduced to 28 base pairs containing the double palindromic sequence TTGTCCCGTGGACAATGTCC. Both domains A and B act by increasing the initiation of specific RNAs.},

Our results were the following: (i) sera were found that efficiently blocked the EBV-specific TK activity of induced-Raji TK- cell extracts, but not the host-cell TK activity from EBV-negative BJAB cells; (ii) a relationship appeared between high levels of EBV-specific TK-neutralizing activity in sera and NPC pathology, even though in this preliminary study the degrees of EBV-induced TK-blocking activity detected in sera were not significantly correlated with EBV-specific antibody titers; (iii) the EBV-induced TK-neutralizing activity was found in the main IgG fraction derived from NPC sera.

These cell lines included a series of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and their EBV-converted counterparts. To infect these cells we used two HIV-1 isolates and one HIV-2 isolate. Infections were monitored with a cytoplasmic RNA dot-blot and a syncytium assay. HIV infection was also studied by a novel method based on electrophoresis of DNA liberated from cells that were lysed in situ in the well of an agarose gel. All human B-cell lines could be infected with HIV-1, regardless of the presence of EBV genomes; thus, EBV infection had no major effect on HIV susceptibility of B-cell lines. Integrated proviral HIV genomes could be detected by Southern blot analysis of DNA extracted from long-term, non-HIV-producing B-cell lines. This study suggests that B-lymphoid cells may serve as reservoirs for latent or persistent HIV infections in vivo, even in the absence of EBV infection.},

These B95.8- and P3HR1-converted lines have been compared for their patterns of expression of EBV latent genes (i.e., those viral genes constitutively expressed in all EBV-transformed lines of normal B-cell origin) and for their recognition by EBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), in an effort to identify which latent gene products provide target antigens for the T-cell response. B95.8-converted lines on several different EBV-negative BL-cell backgrounds all showed detectable expression of the nuclear antigens EBNA1, EBNA2, and EBNA3 and of the latent membrane protein (LMP); such converts were also clearly recognized by EBV-specific CTL preparations with restriction through selected human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I antigens on the target cell surface. The corresponding P3HR1-converted lines (lacking an EBNA2 gene) expressed EBNA1 and EBNA3 but, surprisingly, showed no detectable LMP; furthermore, these converts were not recognized by EBV-specific CTLs. Such differences in T-cell recognition were not due to any differences in expression of the relevant HLA-restricting determinants between the two types of convert, as shown by binding of specific monoclonal antibodies and by the susceptibility of both B95.8 and P3HR1 converts to allospecific CTLs directed against these same HLA molecules. The results suggest that in the normal infectious cycle, EBNA2 may be required for subsequent expression of LMP and that both EBNA2 and LMP (but not EBNA1 or EBNA3) may provide target antigens for the EBV-specific T-cell response.},

The nonimmortalizing EBV variant, strain P3HR-1, which possesses a deletion within the BamHI WYH region of the genome containing the coding sequence for the EBV-determined nuclear antigen 2, does not induce expression of these markers. Other lymphoblastoid cell-associated antigen markers can be activated by infection with either immortalizing or nonimmortalizing viruses. These results suggest that the immortalizing potential of EBV is correlated with its ability to induce expression of B-cell activation markers, which are suspected to play a major role in the physiological pathway leading to lymphoid cell proliferation. The viral genomic region deleted in the nonimmortalizing strain of EBV seems to be required for activation of some of these markers. Human lymphoma cell lines, such as those used in this study, can thus help identify the specific EBV genes involved in lymphoid B-cell proliferation and the mechanism of action of these genes.},

In French Guyana, a South American country bordering the Caribbean sea, differences in antibody distribution across three ethnic groups (black Bonis, Indian Wayanas, and Hmongs from Asia) provide clues for investigation of the mode of HTLV-I transmission. Africa appears to be an endemic continent for HTLV-I and HTLV-III. For both viruses, the antibody prevalence exhibited an increasing gradient from northern to equatorial through Sudanic areas.

This analog has no effect on the growth of noninduced cells (T. Ooka and A. Calender, Virology 104:219-223, 1980). The synthesis of early antigens is not affected by the analog, whereas that of late viral capsid antigens is completely inhibited, as demonstrated by the indirect immunofluorescence technique; kinetic reassociation experiments have also shown that araT strongly inhibits replication of viral DNA. Phosphorylation of the tritiated form of the analog ([3H]araT) was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography in cultures of control and induced cells, and the results demonstrated that only induced cells can convert the analog to the triphosphate form. These results indicate that the selective effect of araT in induced cells is probably related to a new virally induced TK activity. Preliminary characterization of this new activity has shown that it is able to phosphorylate the analog specifically, whereas cellular TKs cannot. araTTP, a final phosphorylation product of araT, is a potent inhibitor of Epstein-Barr virus-specific DNA polymerase, suggesting a possible inhibitory action of this product on Epstein-Barr virus replication.},

	abstract = {Sarcoidosis is a complex, polygenic, inflammatory granulomatous multi-organ disease of unknown cause. The granulomatous inflammation in sarcoidosis is driven by the interplay between T cells and macrophages. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play important roles in intercellular communication. We subjected serum EVs, isolated by size exclusion chromatography, from seven patients with sarcoidosis and five control subjects to non-targeted proteomics analysis. Non-targeted, label-free proteomics analysis detected 2,292 proteins in serum EVs; 42 proteins were upregulated in patients with sarcoidosis relative to control subjects, and 324 proteins were downregulated. The protein signature of EVs from patients with sarcoidosis reflected disease characteristics such as antigen presentation and immunological disease. Candidate biomarkers were further verified by targeted proteomics analysis (selected reaction monitoring) in 46 patients and 10 control subjects. Notably, CD14 and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) were validated by targeted proteomics analysis. Upregulation of these proteins was further confirmed by immunoblotting, and their expression was strongly increased in macrophages of lung granulomatous lesions. Consistent with these findings, CD14 levels were increased in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages during multinucleation, concomitant with increased levels of CD14 and LBP in EVs. The area under the curve values of CD14 and LBP were 0.81 and 0.84, respectively, and further increased to 0.98 in combination with either angiotensin-converting enzyme and soluble interleukin-2 receptor. These findings suggest that CD14 and LBP in serum EVs, which are associated with granulomatous pathogenesis, can improve the diagnostic accuracy in patients with sarcoidosis.},

	abstract = {Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease with gene/protein expression patterns that may be different among different tissues, based on the presence or absence of granulomas, and on subphenotypes with progressive or nonprogressive disease manifestations. There is a growing body of data evaluating global transcriptomic changes across multiple tissue compartments in sarcoidosis. However, whether similar biological pathways are involved is unknown. Furthermore, an understanding of the transcriptional impact on the proteome is required to validate molecular pathways driving heterogeneity in sarcoidosis. The purpose of this study was to compare biological inferences from published datasets and explore the compartment specificity of these responses in sarcoidosis. Common pathways identified across datasets or tissue types may serve as convenient biomarkers and could lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets., Multiple overlapping pathways are identified in tissue, BAL cells, PBMCs and a sarcoidosis in vitro granuloma model. Inferences from omic studies are constrained by small sample sizes. Studies comparing differences between sarcoidosis phenotypes are needed.

	abstract = {Background 
        Hepatic granulomas have been reported in 2–15\% of unselected liver biopsies, with a wide clinical profile responsible for their presence. To date, no series concerning the prevalence and the etiology of granulomas from Greece has been reported.
        Objectives 
        To evaluate the prevalence and the etiology of hepatic granulomas and to investigate whether there has been an alteration in distribution of diagnoses in our series compared with those published so far in the literature.
        Study 
        The results of liver biopsy specimens performed in a Department of Medicine, between 1999 and 2004, were retrospectively reviewed and the cases revealing hepatic granulomas had their medical notes and the liver biopsies recorded.
        Results 
        Over the study period, 1768 liver biopsies were performed. Hepatic granulomas were identified in 66 (3.7\%). Of those, 51 were female with a mean age of 57 years (range 34–74 years) and 15 were male with a mean age of 42 years (range 18–78 years). Autoimmune liver diseases including primary biliary cirrhosis, overlap syndrome and autoimmune hepatitis accounted for the majority of cases (68\%), followed by sarcoidosis (7.5\%), chronic hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infection (7.5\%), idiopathic (6\%), drugs (3\%) and other miscellaneous causes (7.5\%).
        Conclusions 
        Our series showed that autoimmune liver diseases, mainly primary biliary cirrhosis was the most common cause of granuloma formation, a finding rather similar to that stated in the studies from Western countries. A rather small number of idiopathic cases were recorded. Chronic viral hepatitis and sarcoidosis rates were equal, a finding possibly reflecting a fairly high proportion of viral hepatitis in our sample.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is a heterogeneous disease with high variability in natural history and clinical spectrum. The study aimed to reveal different clinical phenotypes of patients with similar characteristics and prognosis.
METHODS: Cluster analysis including 26 phenotypic variables was performed in a large cohort of 694 sarcoidosis patients, collected and followed-up from 1976 to 2018 at Bellvitge University Hospital, Barcelona, Spain.
RESULTS: Six homogeneous groups were identified after cluster analysis: C1 (n=47; 6.8\%), C2 (n=85; 12.2\%), C3 (n=153; 22\%), C4 (n=29; 4.2\%), C5 (n=168; 24.2\%), and C6 (n=212; 30.5\%). Presence of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL) ranged from 65.5\% (C4) to 97.9\% (C1). Patients with Löfgren syndrome (LS) were distributed across 3 phenotypes (C1, C2, and C3). In contrast, phenotypes with pulmonary (PS) and/or extrapulmonary sarcoidosis (EPS) were represented by groups C4 (PS 100\% with no EPS), C5 (PS 88.7\% plus EPS), and C6 (EPS). EPS was concentrated in groups C5 (skin lesions, peripheral and abdominal lymph nodes, and hepatosplenic involvement) and C6 (skin lesions, peripheral lymph nodes, and neurological and ocular involvement). Unlike patients from LS groups, most patients with PS and/or EPS were treated with immunosuppressive therapy, and evolved to chronicity in higher proportion. Finally, the cluster model worked moderately well as a predictive model of chronicity (AUC=0.705).
CONCLUSION: Cluster analysis identified 6 different clinical patterns with similar phenotypic variables and predicted chronicity in our large cohort of patients with sarcoidosis. Classification of sarcoidosis into phenotypes with prognostic value may help physicians to improve the efficacy of clinical decisions.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Sarcoidosis is a T-helper cell mediated disease characterized by granulomatous inflammation. We posited that unsupervised clustering of various features in sarcoidosis would establish phenotypes associated with inflammatory activity measured by 18FDG-PET/CT. Our goal was to identify unique features capable of distinguishing clusters and subsequently examine the relationship with FDG avidity to substantiate their potential use as markers for sarcoidosis inflammation.Methods: We performed a retrospective study of a diverse, but primarily African American, cohort of 58 subjects with biopsy proven sarcoidosis followed at the University of Illinois Bernie Mac Sarcoidosis Center and Center for Lung Health who underwent 18FDG-PET/CT scan. Demographic, therapeutic, radiographic, and laboratory data were utilized in unsupervised cluster analysis to identify sarcoidosis phenotypes. The association between clusters, their defining features, and quantitative measurements on 18FDG-PET/CT was determined. The relevance of these features as markers of 18FDG-PET/CT inflammatory activity was also investigated.Results: Clustering determined three distinct phenotypes: (1) a predominantly African American cluster with chronic, quiescent disease, (2) a predominantly African American cluster with elevated conventional inflammatory markers, advanced pulmonary disease and extrathoracic involvement, and (3) a predominantly Caucasian cluster characterized by reduced lymphocyte counts and acute disease. In contrast to the chronic quiescent cluster, Clusters 2 and 3 were defined by significantly greater FDG avidity on 18FDG-PET/CT. Despite similarly increased inflammatory activity on 18FDG-PET/CT, Clusters 2, and 3 differed with regards to extrathoracic FDG avidity and circulating lymphocyte profiles, specifically CD4+ T-cells. Notably, absolute lymphocyte counts and CD4+ T-cell counts were found to predict 18FDG-PET/CT inflammatory activity by receiver operating curve analysis with a 69.2 and 73.42\% area under the curve, respectively.Conclusions: Utilizing cluster analysis, three distinct phenotypes of sarcoidosis were identified with significant variation in race, disease chronicity, and serologic markers of inflammation. These phenotypes displayed varying levels of circulating inflammatory cells. Additionally, reduction in lymphocytes, specifically CD4+ T-cells, was significantly related to activity on 18FDG-PET/CT. Though future studies are warranted, these findings suggest that peripheral lymphocyte counts may be considered a determinant of sarcoidosis phenotypes and an indicator of active inflammation on 18FDG-PET/CT.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies on sarcoidosis in elderly patients are scarce and none have specifically evaluated patients aged ≥75 at onset.
AIM: We aimed to analyse the characteristics of patients with sarcoidosis diagnosed after 75 and to compare them with those of younger patients.
DESIGN: Multicenter case-control study comparing elderly-onset sarcoidosis (EOS) with young-onset sarcoidosis (YOS) seen at Lyon University Hospitals between 2006 and 2018.
METHODS: Using our institutional database, we included 34 patients in the EOS group and compared them with 102 controls from the YOS group in a 1:3 ratio. Demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical presentation, laboratory and imaging findings, sites of biopsies, histological analyses, treatments and outcomes were recorded using a comprehensive questionnaire.
RESULTS: There were more Caucasians in the EOS group (94.1\% vs. 59.8\%; P {\textless} 0.001), who had significantly more comorbidities (mean, 3.1 ± 2 vs. 1.1 ± 1.6; P {\textless} 0.001). In the EOS group, there was less pulmonary involvement (26.5\% vs. 49\%; P = 0.022), less lymphadenopathy (2.9\% vs. 16.7\%; P = 0.041), no erythema nodosum (0\% vs. 12.8\%; P = 0.029) and no arthralgia (0\% vs. 25.5\%; P = 0.001). Conversely, uveitis was more common in the EOS group (55.9\% vs. 20.6\%; P {\textless} 0.001). Pathological confirmation was obtained significantly less frequently in the EOS group (67.7\% vs. 85.3\%; P = 0.023). Corticosteroid-related side effects were significantly more common in the EOS group (100\% vs. 75.9\%; P = 0.030).
CONCLUSION: Epidemiology and clinical presentation of EOS differs from YOS, including more comorbidities and more uveitis. Elderly patients are more prone to corticosteroid side effects.},

In this essay, we review the evidence that C. neoformans damages host cells and note that the mechanisms involved are diverse. We consider C. neoformans-mediated host damage at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and organism level. Direct mechanisms of cytotoxicity include lytic exocytosis, organelle dysfunction, phagolysosomal membrane damage, and cytoskeletal alterations. Cytotoxicity contributes to pathogenesis by interfering with immune effector cell function and disrupting endothelial barriers thus allowing dissemination. When C. neoformans-mediated and immune-mediated host damage is sufficient to affect homeostasis, cryptococcosis occurs at the organism level.},

	abstract = {Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare demyelinating disease due to a lytic infection of oligodendrocytes caused by polyoma virus (JC virus) infection. PML usually occurs in a setting of severe immunosuppression and is most commonly associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia is a very rare cause of PML and only a few cases have been reported in the literature. We present a case of a 45-year-old man who presented with behavioral alteration followed by progressive weakness of right side of the body. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed confluent irregular areas of T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities in left frontoparietal and right temporoparietal regions. His hematological work up showed a decreased absolute CD4+ count of 217 per microliter, but was negative for HIV serology. Keeping a differential diagnoses of central nervous system lymphoma, brain biopsy was performed. Histopathology revealed demyelination with presence of intranuclear inclusions in the oligodendrocytes, which were positive for SV40 immunostain. Adjacent areas showed reactive gliosis with hypertrophic astrocytes, hence a diagnosis of PML was made. The patient died due to aspiration pneumonia. PML can occur very rarely in association with idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia in the absence of other immunosuppressive illnesses. This report highlights the importance of high index of clinical suspicion and need for a careful histological examination for diagnosis of PML to facilitate adequate patient management.},

The implemented state-of-the-art methods can be categorized into 4 groups: (i) under-sampling, (ii) over-sampling, (iii) combination of over- and under-sampling, and (iv) ensemble learning methods. The proposed toolbox only depends on numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn and is distributed under MIT license. Furthermore, it is fully compatible with scikit-learn and is part of the scikit-learn-contrib supported project. Documentation, unit tests as well as integration tests are provided to ease usage and contribution.

	abstract = {Although anaesthesiologists strive to avoid hypoxaemia during surgery, reliably predicting future intraoperative hypoxaemia is not possible at present. Here, we report the development and testing of a machine-learning-based system that predicts the risk of hypoxaemia and provides explanations of the risk factors in real time during general anaesthesia. The system, which was trained on minute-by-minute data from the electronic medical records of over 50,000 surgeries, improved the performance of anaesthesiologists by providing interpretable hypoxaemia risks and contributing factors. The explanations for the predictions are broadly consistent with the literature and with prior knowledge from anaesthesiologists. Our results suggest that if anaesthesiologists currently anticipate 15\% of hypoxaemia events, with the assistance of this system they could anticipate 30\%, a large portion of which may benefit from early intervention because they are associated with modifiable factors. The system can help improve the clinical understanding of hypoxaemia risk during anaesthesia care by providing general insights into the exact changes in risk induced by certain characteristics of the patient or procedure.},

FHL, an autosomal recessive disease invariably fatal when untreated, is associated with defective triggering of apoptosis and reduced cytotoxic activity, resulting in a widespread accumulation of T lymphocytes and activated macrophages. In 1994 the Histiocyte Society initiated a prospective international collaborative therapeutic study (HLH-94), aiming at improved survival. It combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy (etoposide, corticosteroids, cyclosporin A, and, in selected patients, intrathecal methotrexate), followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in persistent, recurring, and/or familial disease. Between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1998, 113 eligible patients aged no more than 15 years from 21 countries started HLH-94. All had either an affected sibling (n = 25) and/or fulfilled the Histiocyte Society diagnostic criteria. At a median follow-up of 3.1 years, the estimated 3-year probability of survival overall was 55\% (95\% confidence interval ± 9\%), and in the familial cases, 51\% (± 20\%). Twenty enrolled children were alive and off therapy for more than 12 months without BMT. For patients who received transplants (n = 65), died prior to BMT (n = 25), or were still on therapy (n = 3), the 3-year survival was 45\% (± 10\%). The 3-year probability of survival after BMT was 62\% (± 12\%). HLH-94 is very effective, allowing BMT in most patients. Survival of children with HLH has been greatly improved.},

We undertook a study in order to elicit which features constitute helpful criteria for a positive diagnosis. In this Delphi study, the features investigated in the questionnaire and the experts invited to participate in the survey were issued from a bibliographic search. The questionnaire was iteratively proposed to experts via a web-based application with a feedback of the results observed at the preceding Delphi round. Experts were asked to label each investigated criterion in one of the following categories: absolutely required, important, of minor interest, or not assessable in the routine practice environment. A positive consensus was a priori defined as at least 75\% answers observed in the categories absolutely required and important. The questionnaire investigated 26 criteria and 24 experts originating from 13 countries participated in the second and final Delphi round. A positive consensus was reached for the nine following criteria: unilineage cytopenia, bicytopenia, pancytopenia, presence of hemophagocytosis pictures on a bone marrow aspirate or on a tissue biopsy, high ferritin level, fever, organomegaly, presence of a predisposing underlying disease, and high level of lactate dehydrogenase. A negative consensus was reached for 13 criteria, and an absence of consensus was observed for 4 criteria. The study constitutes the first initiative to date for defining international guidelines devoted to the positive diagnosis of the reactive form of hemophagocytic syndrome.},

	doi = {10.1136/bjophthalmol-2020-316563},
	abstract = {AIM: To evaluate the diagnostic worth of elevated serum ACE (sACE) and lymphopaenia, singly or combined, in diagnosing sarcoid uveitis.
METHODS: Monocentric retrospective study, on a cohort of 996 adult patients referred to our department between March 2001 and December 2018 for a diagnostic work-up of uveitis. The sensitivity (SE), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of the two biomarkers were calculated in different contexts.
RESULTS: Eight hundred and sixty-eight patient cases were reviewed. The mean age at uveitis onset was 49.4 (±18.6) years. Of them, 144 patients had a diagnosis of sarcoid uveitis. An elevated sACE had SE of 45.8\%, Sp of 88.8\%, PPV of 44.9\% and NPV of 89.2\% in diagnosing sarcoid uveitis. For lymphopaenia, SE was 15.3\%, Sp was 96.7\%, PPV was 47.8\% and NPV was 85.2\%. For the combination of elevated sACE and lymphopaenia, SE was 18.9\%, Sp was 99.0\%, PPV was 73.9\% and NPV was 89.5\%. The value of this combination varied according to patient age at diagnosis plus anatomoclinical entities: for patients aged ≤50 years, SE was 31.3\%, Sp was 99.7\%, PPV was 90.9\% and NPV was 94.3\%. For granulomatous uveitis, SE was 26.2\%, Sp was 97.3\%, PPV was 73.3\% and NPV was 82.5\%.
CONCLUSION: A combination of elevated serum ACE and lymphopaenia more convincingly suggests sarcoid uveitis than these investigational tests used alone, especially in patients with granulomatous uveitis, while a lack of these markers corresponds to a high NPV.

Areas covered: This review evaluates the potential role of different omics approaches for the development and application of precision medicine to sarcoidosis patients. This systemic and heterogeneous inflammatory disease is of unknown etiology, affects people of any age, and requires genotypic and phenotypic characterization. The latter can be achieved through the integration of genomic (i.e. information about genes and their mutations potentially involved in sarcoidosis), transcriptomic (reflecting the dynamic state of a cell and measuring the transcribed genes over time), and proteomic data (i.e. proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage, lung tissues, lung cells, serum and immunity system). Expert commentary: Genomic studies have revealed numerous aspects of sarcoidosis; however, for precision medicine, it is necessary to implement genomics with other omic approaches. The improving reliability of omics data, their storage, and their bioinformatics processing represents the next step to recapitulate in silico biological systems, with the final aim to simulate potential molecular pathways involved in the pathology and useful for clinical purposes.},

A cohort of 37 Sar patients with chronic persistent pulmonary disease was described in this study. BAL protein profiles from 9 of these Sar patients were compared with those from 8 smoker (SC) and 10 no-smoker controls (NSC) by proteomic approach. Principal Component Analysis was performed to clusterize the samples in the corresponding conditions highlighting a differential pattern profiles primarily in Sar than SC. Spot identification reveals thirty-four unique proteins involved in lipid, mineral, and vitamin Dmetabolism, and immuneregulation of macrophage function. Enrichment analysis has been elaborated by MetaCore, revealing 14-3-3ε, α1-antitrypsin, GSTP1, and ApoA1 as “central hubs”. Process Network as well as Pathway Maps underline proteins involved in immune response and inflammation induced by complement system, innate inflammatory response and IL-6signalling. Disease Biomarker Network highlights Tuberculosis and COPD as pathologies that share biomarkers with sarcoidosis. In conclusion, Sar protein expression profile seems more similar to that of NSC than SC, conversely to other ILDs. Moreover, Disease Biomarker Network revealed several common features between Sar and TB, exhorting to orientate the future proteomics investigations also in comparative BALF analysis of Sar and TB.},

	abstract = {Sarcoidosis is believed to be caused by both genetic and environmental risk factors, but the proportion of the susceptibility to sarcoidosis that is mediated by genetics remains unknown. We aimed to estimate the familial aggregation and heritability of sarcoidosis using a case–control–family study design and population-based Swedish registers.
We identified 23 880 individuals with visits for sarcoidosis in the Swedish National Patient Register using International Classification of Diseases codes (1964‒2013). Information on Löfgren's syndrome was available for a subset diagnosed at Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden). General population controls were matched to cases (10:1). Relatives of cases and controls were identified from the Swedish Multi-Generation Register and ascertained for sarcoidosis in the National Patient Register. We estimated familial relative risks for sarcoidosis using conditional logistic regression and heritability using biometric models.
Having at least one first-degree relative with sarcoidosis was associated with a 3.7-fold increase in the risk of sarcoidosis (95\% CI 3.4−4.1). The relative risk increased in those with two or more relatives (relative risk 4.7) and in Löfgren's syndrome (relative risk 4.1). The heritability was 39\% (95\% CI 12−65\%).
This large investigation showed that having a relative with sarcoidosis is a very strong risk factor for the disease. Genetic variation is an important, albeit partial, contributing factor to the risk for sarcoidosis.

	abstract = {Background: Sarcoidosis is a multiorgan granulomatous inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology. Familial clustering of cases and ethnic variation in the epidemiology suggests a genetic influence on susceptibility to the disease. This paper reports twin concordance and heritability estimates of sarcoidosis in order to assess the overall contribution of genetic factors to the disease susceptibility.
Methods: Monozygotic and dizygotic twins enrolled in the Danish and the Finnish population-based national twin cohorts (61 662 pairs in total) were linked to diagnostic information on sarcoidosis obtained from the Danish National Patient Registry or the Social Insurance Institution, Finland registry of reimbursed medication using the 8th and 10th editions of the International Classification of Diseases. The Fisher exact test was used to compare probandwise concordance rates in different zygosity groups. Heritability was estimated based on a multifactorial threshold liability model.
Results: A total of 210 twin pairs with at least one proband with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis were identified. The probandwise concordance rate was higher in monozygotic than in dizygotic twins (0.148 vs 0.012). Compared with the general population there was an 80-fold increased risk of developing sarcoidosis in co-twins of affected monozygotic brothers or sisters. The increased risk in dizygotic twins was only 7-fold. Aetiological model fitting gave a heritability of sarcoidosis of 0.66 (95\% CI 0.45 to 0.80).
Conclusions: This study suggests that genetic factors play an important role in the susceptibility to sarcoidosis. This result should encourage the search for molecular genetic markers of susceptibility to the disease.},

	abstract = {Sarcoidosis is an unpredictable granulomatous disease in which African Americans disproportionately experience aggressive phenotypes. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) released by cells in response to various stressors contributes to tissue remodelling and inflammation. While extracellular mtDNA has emerged as a biomarker in multiple diseases, its relevance to sarcoidosis remains unknown. We aimed to define an association between extracellular mtDNA and clinical features of sarcoidosis.
Extracellular mtDNA concentrations were measured using quantitative PCR for the human MT-ATP6 gene in bronchoalveolar (BAL) and plasma samples from healthy controls and patients with sarcoidosis from The Yale Lung Repository; associations between MT-ATP6 concentrations and Scadding stage, extrapulmonary disease and demographics were sought. Results were validated in the Genomic Research in Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency and Sarcoidosis cohort.
Relative to controls, MT-ATP6 concentrations in sarcoidosis subjects were robustly elevated in the BAL fluid and plasma, particularly in the plasma of patients with extrapulmonary disease. Relative to Caucasians, African Americans displayed excessive MT-ATP6 concentrations in the BAL fluid and plasma, for which the latter compartment correlated with significantly higher odds of extrapulmonary disease.
Enrichments in extracellular mtDNA in sarcoidosis are associated with extrapulmonary disease and African American descent. Further study into the mechanistic basis of these clinical findings may lead to novel pathophysiologic and therapeutic insights.

	abstract = {Overt infection by Propionibacterium acnes is lacking in many SAPHO syndromes, and antibiotics have only a transient and incomplete effect, either in SAPHO syndrome or acne. As several auto-inflammatory bone disorders sharing overproduction of IL-1β can mimic SAPHO, this syndrome could partly depend on genetically encoded overproduction of IL-1β. However, cyclic intracellular infections, mostly by P. acnes, can contribute to the enhanced IL-1β release by some skin cells, and probably by bone cells. P. acnes is indeed a powerful trigger of NLRP3-inflammasome activation and IL-1β, leading to osteitis and enhanced mesenchymal cells differentiation in osteoblasts. Recent advances in the understanding of acne suggest that first steps of this disorder are not driven by P. acnes, but by a relative deficiency of FoxO1 within the nucleus of sebaceous cells. A similar defect of FoXO1 in bone cells should also be sought in SAPHO, since repression of FoxO1 gene is found in lesional psoriasis skin, and is associated with an increased number of osteoblasts and high bone mass in mice. FoxO1 selectively promotes IL-1β production, so that its downregulation could help some P. acnes t escape innate immunity and persist in a latent state in bone cells, including mesenchymal stem cells. However, P. acnes itself possibly contributes to FoxO1 downregulation, like H. pylori infection which induces nuclear inactivation of FoxO1 in human gastric cells to slow down autophagic clearance. As bisphosphonates, which often improve SAPHO syndromes, enhance autophagy, it may be worth testing whether their combination with antibiotics is synergistic in SAPHO syndromes.},

	abstract = {The pandemic situation of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global threat on our current planet, with its rapid spread and high mortality rate. Sarcoidosis patients are at high risk to COVID-19 severity for having lung injuries as well as treating with immunosuppressive agents. So, physicians are in dilemma whether they should use immunosuppressive agents or not for the patients with sarcoidosis history and COVID-19 infection. Therefore, common factors should be identified to provide effective treatment. For determining the common genes between COVID-19 and sarcoidosis, GSE164805 and GSE18781 were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Common upregulated genes were identified by using R language to investigate their involved pathways and gene ontologies (GO). With the aid of the STRING Cytoscape plugin tool, protein-protein interactions (PPIs) network was constructed. From the PPIs network, Hub genes and essential modules were detected by using Cytohubba, and MCODE respectively. For hub genes, TFs, TFs-miRNA, and drug, interaction networks were built through the NetworkAnalyst web platform. A total of 34 common upregulated genes were identified and among them, five hub genes, including TET2, MUC5AC, VDR, NFE2L2, and BCL6 were determined. In addition, a cluster having VDR and NFE2L2 was detected from the PPIs network. Moreover, 32 transcription factors and 9 miRNA were recognized for hub genes. Furthermore, vitamin D and some of its analogous compounds were obtained from the drug interaction network. In conclusion, hub genes identified in this study might have potential roles in modulating COVID-19 infection and sarcoidosis. However, further studies are required to corroborate this study.},

We performed a retrospective study of all adult patients with at least one GF measurement over a 2-year period in one hospital laboratory. The diagnosis of AOSD was based on the expert opinion of the treating physician and validated by two independent investigators. Patients' characteristics, disease activity, and outcome were recorded and compared. Twenty-eight AOSD and 203 controls were identified. Compared to controls, the mean GF was significantly lower (22.3\% vs. 39.3, p \&lt; 0.001) in AOSD patients. GF had a high diagnostic accuracy for AOSD, independent of disease activity or total serum ferritin (AUC: 0.674 to 0.915). The GF optimal cut-off value for AOSD diagnosis was 16\%, yielding a specificity of 89\% and a sensitivity of 63\%. We propose a modified diagnostic score for AOSD, based on Fautrel's criteria but with a GF threshold of 16\% that provides greater specificity and increases the positive predictive value by nearly 5 points. GF is useful for ruling out differential diagnoses and as an appropriate classification criterion for use in AOSD clinical trials.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces stacked generalization, a scheme for minimizing the generalization error rate of one or more generalizers. Stacked generalization works by deducing the biases of the generalizer(s) with respect to a provided learning set. This deduction proceeds by generalizing in a second space whose inputs are (for example) the guesses of the original generalizers when taught with part of the learning set and trying to guess the rest of it, and whose output is (for example) the correct guess. When used with multiple generalizers, stacked generalization can be seen as a more sophisticated version of cross-validation, exploiting a strategy more sophisticated than cross-validation's crude winner-takes-all for combining the individual generalizers. When used with a single generalizer, stacked generalization is a scheme for estimating (and then correcting for) the error of a generalizer which has been trained on a particular learning set and then asked a particular question. After introducing stacked generalization and justifying its use, this paper presents two numerical experiments. The first demonstrates how stacked generalization improves upon a set of separate generalizers for the NETtalk task of translating text to phonemes. The second demonstrates how stacked generalization improves the performance of a single surface-fitter. With the other experimental evidence in the literature, the usual arguments supporting cross-validation, and the abstract justifications presented in this paper, the conclusion is that for almost any real-world generalization problem one should use some version of stacked generalization to minimize the generalization error rate. This paper ends by discussing some of the variations of stacked generalization, and how it touches on other fields like chaos theory.},

In this context, it becomes an important topic in the data mining field that how to effectively construct an efficient knowledge discovery and mining model. Ensemble learning, as one research hot spot, aims to integrate data fusion, data modeling, and data mining into a unified framework. Specifically, ensemble learning firstly extracts a set of features with a variety of transformations. Based on these learned features, multiple learning algorithms are utilized to produce weak predictive results. Finally, ensemble learning fuses the informative knowledge from the above results obtained to achieve knowledge discovery and better predictive performance via voting schemes in an adaptive way. In this paper, we review the research progress of the mainstream approaches of ensemble learning and classify them based on different characteristics. In addition, we present challenges and possible research directions for each mainstream approach of ensemble learning, and we also give an extra introduction for the combination of ensemble learning with other machine learning hot spots such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, etc.},

In this retrospective study, we report 70 cases of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS) among 1696 DLBCL-NOS cases diagnosed between 2006 and 2019 (prevalence of 4.1\%). At diagnosis, median age was 68.5 years; 79\% of the cases presented with an advanced-stage disease (III-IV), 48\% with extranodal lesions, and 14\% with an hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) (8 at diagnosis and 1 on therapy). A total of 46 cases presented a polymorphic pattern, and 21 were monomorphic. All had a non-germinal center B phenotype, with the majority of tumor cells expressing CD30 and programmed death ligand 1 (98\% and 95\%, respectively). Type II and III EBV latency was seen in 88\% and 12\% of the cases, respectively. Patients were treated with immunochemotherapy (59\%) or chemotherapy (22\%), and 19\% received palliative care due to advanced age and altered performance status. After a median follow-up of 48 months, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) at 5 years were 52.7\% and 54.8\%, respectively. Older age (\&gt;50 years) and HLH were associated with shorter PFS and OS in multivariate analysis (PFS: hazard ratio [HR], 14.01; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.34-83.97; and HR, 5.78; 95\% CI, 2.35-14.23; OS: HR, 12.41; 95\% CI, 1.65-93.53; and HR, 6.09; 95\% CI, 2.42-15.30, respectively).

Familial forms of HLH are currently treated with chemotherapy as a bridge to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. HLH occurring in rheumatic disease (macrophage activation syndrome) is treated with glucocorticoids, IL-1 blockade, or cyclosporine A.

This was a descriptive study of cases referred to the department of Pathology for bone marrow examination with suspicion or diagnosis of HLH from Jan 2015 to June 2017. The clinical records of these patients were analysed and diagnosed as positive and negative for HLH using the HLH 2004 guidelines and HScore, the scoring system developed by Fardet et al. Fifty cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The variables fever, hepato and /or splenomegaly, high triglyceride levels and marrow hemophagocytosis are highly significant to predict an individuals risk of HLH. We propose a cut-off of ≥ 166 for the diagnosis of HLH by using HScore. If 4 of the 7 criteria are fulfilled by HLH 2004 guidelines, there is an 80\% probability of having HLH by HScore. The HScore is less restrictive in confirming a diagnosis of HLH compared to the HLH 2004 guidelines. HScore is a simple, and cost effective tool for diagnosis of reactive HLH. The higher the HScore, more is the probability of HLH.},

We performed a retrospective analysis of adult patients with at least one total serum ferritin (TSF) measurement ≥ 5000 µg/L over 2 years, in three university hospitals. Conditions associated with hyperferritinemia were collected, and patients were classified into 10 etiological groups. Intensive care unit (ICU) transfer and mortality rates were recorded. A total of 495 patients were identified, of which 56\% had a TSF level between 5000 and 10,000 µg/L. There were multiple underlying causes in 81\% of the patients. The most common causes were infections (38\%), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH, 18\%), and acute hepatitis (14\%). For TSF levels \&gt; 10,000 µg/L, there were no solid cancer or hematological malignancy without another cause of hyperferritinemia. Isolated iron-overload syndromes never exceeded TSF levels \&gt; 15,000 µg/L. Extreme hyperferritinemia (TSF levels \&gt; 25,000 µg/L) was associated with only four causes: HLH, infections, acute hepatitis and cytokine release syndromes. A total of 32\% of patients were transferred to an ICU, and 28\% died. Both ICU transfer rate and mortality were statistically associated with ferritin levels. An optimized threshold of 13,405 μg/L was the best predictor for the diagnosis of HLH, with a sensitivity of 76.4\% and a specificity of 79.3\%. Hyperferritinemia reflects a variety of conditions, but only four causes are associated with extreme hyperferritinemia, in which HLH and acute hepatitis are the most common. Extreme hyperferritinemia has a poor prognosis with increased mortality.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We sought to identify the clinical variables most critical to successful treatment of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among the factors tested were age at diagnosis ({\textless} 2 years or ≥ 2 years), time from diagnosis to initiation of treatment with or without etoposide-containing regimens, timing of cyclosporin A (CSA) administration during induction therapy, and the presence or absence of etoposide.
RESULTS: By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the overall survival rate for the entire cohort of 47 patients, most of whom had moderately severe to severe disease, was 78.3\% ± 6.7\% (SE) at 4 years. The probability of long-term survival was significantly higher when etoposide treatment was begun less than 4 weeks from diagnosis (90.2\% ± 6.9\% v 56.5\% ± 12.6\% for patients receiving this agent later or not at all; P {\textless} .01, log-rank test). Multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated the independent prognostic significance of a short interval from EBV-HLH diagnosis to etoposide administration (relative risk of death for patients lacking this feature, 14.1; 95\% confidence interval, 1.16 to 166.7; P = .04). None of the competing variables analyzed had significant predictive strength in the Cox model. However, concomitant use of CSA with etoposide in a subset of patients appears to have prevented serious complications from neutropenia during the first year of treatment.
CONCLUSION: We conclude that early administration of etoposide, preferably with CSA, is the treatment of choice for patients with EBV-HLH.},

The median age of survivors was 29.6k11.5 yr significantly younger than those who died (54.75173 yr). Twenty patients had no obvious underlying disease, the other 13 had hematological malignancies or viral infections. Comparison of laboratory data revealed that nonsurvivors had significantly lower Hb and platelet values on admission. During treatment, worsening of anemia and thrombocytopenia, increase of transaminase and biliary enzymes were similarly more prominent. Risk factors associated with death were: age over 30 yr, presence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, increased ferritin and P,-microglobulin, anemia accompanied by thrombocytopenia and jaundice.

Severe hyperinflammation caused by uncontrolled proliferation of activated lymphocytes and histiocytes (macrophages) secreting high amounts of inflammatory cytokines threatens the life of the patient and may lead to death unless arrested by appropriate treatment. HLH can be caused either by certain underlying genetic diseases (familial HLH), or may also occur due to particular triggers in patients with no known inherited disorder (acquired HLH). Due to life threatening nature of the disease, early diagnosis and initiation of immunosuppressive therapy is extremely important. HLH diagnosis is based on constellation of clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters which often overlap with those of severe infection or sepsis. Identification of patients with familial HLH and their underlying genetic defects requires specialized laboratory tests and is important for predicting relapses and planning early therapeutic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A high suspicion and thorough clinical, immunological and genetic work-up is required for diagnosis of HLH. Prompt initiation of adequate treatment is essential for the survival.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) can be familial or secondary, which is often triggered by infection or malignancy. HLH therapy includes dexamethasone and etoposide. However, therapy is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Anakinra, a recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, has been reported to treat macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), rheumatic sHLH. We report our experience with anakinra to treat patients with nonrheumatic secondary HLH (sHLH).
PROCEDURE: Six children were diagnosed with HLH from December 2014 to August 2016 and were treated with subcutaneous anakinra (6-10 mg/kg/day divided over four doses) with or without dexamethasone (10 mg/m2 /day). Therapy was either escalated or weaned based on clinical and laboratory response.
RESULTS: Five of six patients were treated with anakinra and dexamethasone, and one with anakinra alone due to active cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis. The median age of diagnosis was 1.8 years (range 0.8-14.9 years). No pathogenic mutations associated with HLH were identified, but three of six possessed genetic variants of unknown significance. Infectious triggers were identified for four patients and two patients had malignancies. The average treatment duration was 8 weeks with 3.5-5.5 years of follow up. No patient needed escalation of therapy to include etoposide. All patients achieved remission. Anakinra was well tolerated without significant adverse effects.
CONCLUSION: Initial treatment with anakinra (with or without dexamethasone) is a feasible treatment alternative for patients with secondary HLH and may allow for avoidance of etoposide. We recommend early initiation of anakinra when HLH is suspected. A broader investigation of the use of anakinra as a first-line agent for HLH is ongoing.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the benefit of the recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist anakinra in treating pediatric patients with secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) associated with rheumatic and nonrheumatic conditions.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review of all anakinra-treated patients with secondary HLH/MAS was performed at Children's of Alabama from January 2008 through December 2016. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and genetic characteristics, outcomes data, and information on concurrent treatments were collected from the records and analyzed using appropriate univariate statistical approaches to assess changes following treatment and associations between patient variables and outcomes.
RESULTS: Forty-four patients with secondary HLH/MAS being treated with anakinra were identified in the electronic medical records. The median duration of hospitalization was 15 days. The mean pretreatment serum ferritin level was 33,316 ng/ml and dropped to 14,435 ng/ml (57\% decrease) within 15 days of the start of anakinra treatment. The overall mortality rate in the cohort was 27\%. Earlier initiation of anakinra (within 5 days of hospitalization) was associated with reduced mortality (P = 0.046), whereas thrombocytopenia (platelet count {\textless}100,000/μl) and STXBP2 mutations were both associated with increased mortality (P = 0.008 and P = 0.012, respectively). In considering patients according to their underlying diagnosis, those with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) had the lowest mortality rate, with no deaths among the 13 systemic JIA patients included in the study (P = 0.006). In contrast, those with an underlying hematologic malignancy had the highest mortality rate, at 100\% (n = 3).
CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that anakinra appears to be effective in treating pediatric patients with non-malignancy-associated secondary HLH/MAS, especially when it is given early in the disease course and when administered to patients who have an underlying rheumatic disease.},

We report on a series of critically ill adult patients treated with a non-etoposide-based regimen including interleukin 1 antagonist anakinra, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and/or corticosteroids (CS) for HLH.
METHODS: Eight adult (≥18 years) ICU patients having received treatment with anakinra ± IVIG ± CS for HLH between March 2014 and March 2016 at a large tertiary care university hospital (Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria) were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: Eight patients (median age: 38 years; range: 20-58 years; 4 males and 4 females) received anakinra together with IVIG (n = 7) and/or high-dose CS (n = 5) for suspected reactive HLH (median H-score: 214; range: 171-288). Seven (88\%) patients required vasopressors and invasive mechanical ventilation and 6 (75\%) patients required renal replacement therapy (median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score at HLH diagnosis: 9.5; range: 6-14). Six patients showed a significant decline in the SOFA score at 1 and 2 weeks following treatment initiation (P = .03), and the remainder 2 patients experienced early death. Five patients survived to ICU discharge, 4 of them could further be discharged from hospital (hospital survival rate: 50\%). No overt treatment-related toxicity was noted.
CONCLUSION: Anakinra in combination with IVIG and/or CS resulted in a hospital survival rate of 50\% in 8 critically ill adult patients with HLH despite a vast degree of organ dysfunction and the need for aggressive ICU treatment. Further research on non-etoposide-based treatment strategies for HLH in critically ill adults is warranted.},

Timely diagnosis is important, since early treatment can improve survival rates. However, completing all assessments needed to reach ≥5 positive criteria out of the 8 HLH-2004 criteria can be time consuming and may delay timely initiation of treatment. Hence, we applied a data-driven approach to identify a minimal parameter set for early decision-making towards the initiation of HLH-specific treatment. We retrospectively evaluated 165 patients from five Dutch tertiary hospitals with suspected HLH. Sixteen pHLH (median age 0.5 years) and 70 sHLH patients (median age 8.7 years) were identified using the HLH-2004 criteria. Clustering analysis and multi-receiver operator characteristics were used to identify parameters distinctive of HLH. The presence of either increased ferritin, cytopenia in ≥2 lineages, or splenomegaly distinguished HLH from non-HLH cases with a negative predictive value of 100\%. A minimal parameter set consisting of 2 major criteria (phagocytosis and splenomegaly) and 3 minor criteria (cytopenia, increased ferritin, and increased triglycerides/low fibrinogen) predicted HLH with 95\% (88-99) sensitivity and 94\% (86-98) specificity. This finding was replicated in an independent retrospective validation cohort of 109 US patients (n = 109). By dividing a subset of the HLH-2004 criteria into major and minor criteria, this strategy uses the evaluation of less than 5 criteria to quickly identify patients with HLH. When confirmed in a prospective setting, this approach could be of value for timely diagnosis and treatment of HLH.},

Methods:  Routine blood samples were obtained (n = 413) from workers (age: median 38, range: 21–66 years) involved in a health care prevention program, to determine means, standard deviations (SDs), 95\% confidence inter‑vals (95\% CI), percentiles P2.5 and P97.5. A second independent sample of healthy volunteers is compared (n = 29).
Results:  The mean NLR is 1.65 [±1.96 SD: 0.78–3.53] (95\% CI [0.75–0.81] and [3.40–3.66]). In the second cohort (healthy control), the NLR values are in the same range, whichever the used analyzer. No NLR assessed in the valida‑tion series is out of the proposed limits.
Conclusions:  We have identified that the normal NLR values in an adult, non-geriatric, population in good health are between 0.78 and 3.53. These data will help to define the normal values of the NLR.},

	abstract = {Purpose Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare systematic immune disease manifested with excessive activation of lymphocytes and macrophages. This study was designed to explore the feasible prognostic factors of secondary HLH (sHLH).
Method We retrospectively analyzed 179 patients with newly diagnosed sHLH from January 2016 to May 2019 according to the HLH-2004 protocol. Baseline characteristics and laboratory results were reviewed.
Results The median age of all patients was 53 years, with a male/female ratio of 1.45. The commonest cause of HLH was malignancy. Of the 179 patients, 48.6\% presented with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, 92.8\% with hemocytopenia (at least 2 lineages), 60.3\% with hypofibrinogenemia, 43.0\% with hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 3 mmol/L), 99.4\% with high ferritin, 97.8\% with fever, 72.1\% with splenomegaly, and 72.6\% with hemophagocytosis. As to their prognosis, 122 patients died; the median survival was 88 days, with a 2-year survival rate of 26.72\%. Univariate analysis confirmed neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio ˃ 2.53, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) ≤ 4.43, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio ˃ 227.27, red blood cell distribution width ˃ 14.6, red blood cell distribution width-to-platelet ratio (RPR) {\textgreater} 0.33, EBV infection, platelet ≤ 34 × 109 /L, fibrinogen ≤ 1.34 g/ L, alkaline phosphatase ˃ 182.4 U/L, adenosine deaminase ˃ 69.2 U/L, and ferritin ˃ 2318 ng/mL were associated with an inferior survival. In a multivariate model, LMR, RPR, and ferritin were considered as three independent factors.
Conclusion Some blood-based inflammatory markers, which can be easily and cheaply detected, are significantly associated with the OS of HLH patients. LMR and RPR, superior to NLR, PLR, RDW, can be taken to predict the OS of patients with HLH.},

	abstract = {Sarcoidosis is a highly variable, systemic granulomatous disease of hitherto unknown aetiology. The GenPhenReSa (Genotype–Phenotype Relationship in Sarcoidosis) project represents a European multicentre study to investigate the influence of genotype on disease phenotypes in sarcoidosis.
The baseline phenotype module of GenPhenReSa comprised 2163 Caucasian patients with sarcoidosis who were phenotyped at 31 study centres according to a standardised protocol.
From this module, we found that patients with acute onset were mainly female, young and of Scadding type I or II. Female patients showed a significantly higher frequency of eye and skin involvement, and complained more of fatigue. Based on multidimensional correspondence analysis and subsequent cluster analysis, patients could be clearly stratified into five distinct, yet undescribed, subgroups according to predominant organ involvement: 1) abdominal organ involvement, 2) ocular–cardiac–cutaneous–central nervous system disease involvement, 3) musculoskeletal–cutaneous involvement, 4) pulmonary and intrathoracic lymph node involvement, and 5) extrapulmonary involvement.
These five new clinical phenotypes will be useful to recruit homogenous cohorts in future biomedical studies.

	abstract = {Granulomas are organized aggregates of macrophages, often with characteristic morphological changes, and other immune cells. These evolutionarily ancient structures form in response to persistent particulate stimuli—infectious or noninfectious—that individual macrophages cannot eradicate. Granulomas evolved as protective responses to destroy or sequester particles but are frequently pathological in the context of foreign bodies, infections, and inflammatory diseases. We summarize recent findings that suggest that the granulomatous response unfolds in a stepwise program characterized by a series of macrophage activations and transformations that in turn recruit additional cells and produce structural changes. We explore why different granulomas vary and the reasons that granulomas are protective and pathogenic. Understanding the mechanisms and role of granuloma formation may uncover new therapies for the multitude of granulomatous diseases that constitute serious medical problems while enhancing the protective function of granulomas in infections.},

	abstract = {Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disorder of unknown cause that is characterized by granuloma formation in affected organs, most often in the lungs. Patients frequently suffer from cough, shortness of breath, chest pain and pronounced fatigue and are at risk of developing lung fibrosis or irreversible damage to other organs. The disease develops in genetically predisposed individuals with exposure to an as-yet unknown antigen. Genetic factors affect not only the risk of developing sarcoidosis but also the disease course, which is highly variable and difficult to predict. The typical T cell accumulation, local T cell immune response and granuloma formation in the lungs indicate that the inflammatory response in sarcoidosis is induced by specific antigens, possibly including self-antigens, which is consistent with an autoimmune involvement. Diagnosis can be challenging for clinicians because of the potential for almost any organ to be affected. As the aetiology of sarcoidosis is unknown, no specific treatment and no pathognomic markers exist. Thus, improved biomarkers to determine disease activity and to identify patients at risk of developing fibrosis are needed. Corticosteroids still constitute the first-line treatment, but new treatment strategies, including those targeting quality-of-life issues, are being evaluated and should yield appropriate, personalized and more effective treatments.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: There have been no recent comprehensive studies of the epidemiology of sarcoidosis in the United States. Changes in health care use have made available access to data on large numbers of patients with sarcoidosis.
OBJECTIVES: To use a U.S. national health care database to gather data on patients with sarcoidosis identified over a 3-year period who were 18 years of age and older, and to determine health care costs for these patients.
METHODS: The Optum health care database was queried for a 3-year period (2010-2013). This database includes approximately 15\% of U.S. residents. The incidence rate of sarcoidosis was calculated for new cases identified in each year. Calculation of prevalence was based on any patient with sarcoidosis seen during the year. Incidence and prevalence rates are reported per 100,000 patients.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 29,372 adult patients with sarcoidosis were identified. Of these, 14,700 (55\%) were over 55 years of age at the time of diagnosis. The incidence and prevalence rates were higher for African Americans (17.8 and 141.4 per 100,000, respectively) than for white individuals (8.1 and 49.8), Hispanics (4.3 and 21.7), or Asians (3.2 and 18.9). Women were two times more likely to have sarcoidosis, with the highest prevalence for sarcoidosis noted in African American women (178.5). Overall, the yearly health care cost reported for patients with sarcoidosis was low, with a median of \$18,663 per year. However, the yearly cost for the top 5\% was \$93,201.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients 18 years of age and older enrolled in a U.S. national administrative database, sarcoidosis was more common among African Americans, but it was reported for all four of the major ethnic groups studied. While health care costs were relatively small for most patients, the cost of care for some patients was considerable.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous and inflammatory disorder that most often involves the lungs but also affects many other organs. Data on sarcoidosis from large epidemiological studies remain scarce.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the baseline prevalence and 22-year incidence of sarcoidosis and their associations with demographic and geographic characteristics in a large cohort of U.S. women.
METHODS: The Nurses' Health Study II is a prospective cohort study of U.S. female nurses enrolled in 1989 (aged 25-44 yr, n = 116,430). Data on major illnesses were collected through biennial questionnaires (1989-2011). Cases were identified by the nurses' self-report of physician-diagnosed sarcoidosis. Associations of demographic and geographic characteristics with sarcoidosis were evaluated by logistic regression and Cox models.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 377 sarcoidosis cases were identified. The baseline prevalence was 100/100,000 women. The average annual incidence rate was 11/100,000 during 2,275,028 person-years of follow up. Incidence rate increased with age (P = 0.003), from 9 to 15/100,000 in women aged less than 35 to 55 or more years, respectively. Black women had a higher prevalence (odds ratio, 5.24; 95\% confidence interval, 2.87-9.55) and incidence (hazard ratio, 3.80; 95\% confidence interval, 2.31-6.24) than white women. Across U.S. regions, more than twofold differences were observed in sarcoidosis prevalence and incidence, with consistently higher rates in the Northeast.
CONCLUSIONS: We provide recent national data on the epidemiology of sarcoidosis among U.S. women. Important differences in prevalence and incidence were observed across U.S. regions. Large epidemiological studies are needed to better understand the causes of the observed demographic and geographic differences in sarcoidosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disorder of unknown cause that occurs among men and women of all races. In the United States, black women are most frequently and most severely affected. There have been few epidemiologic studies of sarcoidosis focusing on black women.
METHODS: In this article, we present data on incidence, prevalence, and clinical characteristics of sarcoidosis among participants in the Black Women's Health Study, a cohort study of 59,000 black women from across the United States. Data on incident disease and potential risk factors are obtained through biennial questionnaires. Follow-up has been {\textgreater} 80\% through six completed cycles.
RESULTS: There were 685 prevalent cases of sarcoidosis at baseline in 1995 and 435 incident cases reported during 611,585 person-years of follow-up through 2007, for an average annual incidence rate of 71/100,000 and a current prevalence of 2.0\%. The sarcoid diagnosis was confirmed in 96\% of self-reported cases for whom medical records or physician checklists were obtained. The most frequently affected site was the lung. Most patients also had extrapulmonary involvement, with the most common sites being lymph nodes, skin, and eyes. Prednisone had the highest prevalence of use, followed by inhaled corticosteroids.
CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms previous reports of high incidence and prevalence of sarcoidosis among black women, as well as the extent of extrapulmonary disease, frequent need for steroid therapy, and comorbid conditions in this population. The prospective identification of sarcoidosis cases from a defined population will enable a valid assessment of risk factors for incident disease as follow-up continues.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize the epidemiology of sarcoidosis from 1946 through 2013.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: An inception cohort of patients with incident sarcoidosis from January 1, 1976, through December 31, 2013, in Olmsted County, Minnesota, was identified based on comprehensive individual medical record review. Inclusion required physician diagnosis supported by histopathologic confirmation, radiologic features of intrathoracic sarcoidosis, and a compatible clinical presentation. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, laboratory investigations, and mortality. The data were augmented with a previously identified cohort of Olmsted County residents diagnosed as having sarcoidosis in 1946-1975. Incidence rates were age and sex adjusted to the 2010 US white population.
RESULTS: A total of 448 incident cases of sarcoidosis were identified (mean age, 44.2 years; 52\% women). The annual incidence of sarcoidosis was 10.0 per 100,000 population. The incidence of sarcoidosis increased in women from 1950 to 1960, but otherwise there were no significant calendar year trends. However, the peak age at incidence for women shifted from 40 to 59 years in 1950 to 50 to 69 years in 2010. Similarly, the peak age at incidence for men shifted from 30 to 49 years in 1950 to 40 to 59 years in 2010. Ninety-seven percent of patients had intrathoracic involvement, but only 43\% had respiratory symptoms. The overall mortality of patients with sarcoidosis was not different from that of the general population (standardized mortality ratio=0.90; 95\% CI, 0.74-1.08).
CONCLUSION: Sarcoidosis occurred in approximately 10 persons per 100,000 per year. Most of the patients had intrathoracic involvement, although less than half had respiratory symptoms. Overall mortality was not different from that of the general population.},

A total of 1,027 patients were enrolled from a cluster encompassing 79.4\% of the entire Japanese population. The study participants consisted of 364 males and 663 females, providing an average incidence rate of 1.01 per 100,000 inhabitants (0.73 for males and 1.28 for females). The age-specific incidence rate displayed a biphasic pattern in the whole patient population and in the females. The male incidence rates peaked in the 20-34-yr-old group. A second peak for 50-60-yr-old females showed a higher incidence than the first younger peak. Patients with abnormalities in eyes, skin and cardiac laboratory findings accounted for 54.8, 35.4 and 23.0\% of cases, respectively. The female/male incidence ratio was increased, and the frequency of eye and skin involvement and cardiac abnormality was higher than in previous surveys conducted in Japan.

To determine racial differences in sarcoidosis incidence in a metropolitan population the authors conducted a study of newly diagnosed cases that occurred between 1990 and 1994 among members of the Health Alliance Plan health maintenance organization in Detroit, Michigan. The study population was racially heterogeneous, was limited to individuals aged 20-69 years, and comprised about 5\% of the Detroit metropolitan area population in that age group. Annual age-adjusted incidence, in number of new cases per 100,000, was highest in African-American females (39.1 cases). The next highest incidence was found in African-American males (29.8 cases), followed by Caucasian females (12.1) and Caucasian males (9.6). African-American females aged 30-39 years were at the greatest risk, with an annual incidence of 107/100,000. Overall, African Americans had about a threefold higher age-adjusted annual incidence (35.5/100,000) compared with Caucasians (10.9/100,000). Additional adjustment for sex, area of residence, and year of study resulted in 3.8-fold greater risk for African Americans compared with Caucasians. This study further confirmed the higher incidence of sarcoidosis in African Americans compared with Caucasians, but the racial difference was lower than previously reported. The results should be more generalizable than previous studies done with select populations and should serve as a useful frame of reference for future epidemiologic research of sarcoidosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: National surveys conducted in Japan between 1960 and 2004 suggest a gradually increasing incidence of sarcoidosis in women {\textgreater}50 years old with increased involvement of the eye, skin, and heart. However, whether this involvement is due to the increased age at diagnosis is still unclear. We aimed here to identify the age-related differences in organ involvement in sarcoidosis in Japan, as well as the historical changes in clinical characteristics and the age-specific distribution of cases at diagnosis.
METHODS: We reviewed 588 consecutive Japanese patients newly diagnosed with sarcoidosis between 1974 and 2012 at Jichi Medical University Hospital. We compared organ involvement between subgroups differentiated by sex and age ({\textless}45 years; n = 275; ≥45 years; n = 313) at diagnosis and identified historical changes in the age-specific distribution in 10-year intervals.
RESULTS: Younger patients had more common involvement of extrathoracic lymph nodes, parotid/salivary gland, and liver, while older patients had more common involvement of non-lymphatic extrathoracic organs such as the eye, heart, muscle, and kidney. The age at diagnosis has consistently increased over the past four decades. The monophasic distribution in men has tended to become biphasic, and the biphasic distribution in women monophasic. Increasing trends were apparent for hypercalcemia and involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, skin, nervous system, muscle, and kidney.
CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients at diagnosis had various extrathoracic involvement including eye, skin, and cardiac lesions. Moreover, the age at diagnosis of sarcoidosis has continued to increase in both sexes, influencing the recent trends in clinical characteristics.},

Through its inherent representation of the complex genetics underpinning immune cell dysregulation in sarcoidosis, a recently developed in vitro human granuloma model holds promise in providing detailed mechanistic insight into sarcoidosis-specific disease regulating pathways at play during early stages of granuloma formation. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate current sarcoidosis models and assess their potential to progress the field toward the goal of improved therapies in this disease.

OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study aimed to assess the incidence and prevalence of sarcoidosis in Guadeloupe over a 7-year period and to determine its epidemiological, clinical, and evolutionary characteristics.
METHODS: Patients were identified through the computerized databases of the three pathology laboratories and two hospitals on the islands of Guadeloupe. Histologically proven cases of sarcoidosis were selected. All patients were recalled at a single study time-point.
RESULTS: A total of 75 patients were identified. These included 44 women and 31 men (sex ratio: 1.4), with a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 47 ± 14 years and Fitzpatrick skin types IV-VI. The average incidence was 2.28 per 100,000 inhabitants per year (95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.69-3.02). The prevalence of sarcoidosis in 2009 was 21.09 per 100,000 inhabitants (95\% CI 16.00-26.18). Most patients (61/71, 85.9\%) exhibited multiple organ involvement; the mean ± SD number of organs involved was 2.6 ± 1.1. The initiation of systemic therapy was required in 75.7\% of cases. Several lines of treatment were necessary in 41.5\% of affected patients. At the study time-point, seven patients were found to have died. Four of these deaths were directly attributable to sarcoidosis (mortality rate: 5.3\%).
CONCLUSIONS: This epidemiological study on sarcoidosis in Guadeloupe reveals a low incidence of the disease and a high degree of severity as evidenced by the average number of affected organs, the high frequency of extrathoracic organ involvement, the frequent use of corticosteroids, and a mortality rate of 5.3\%.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas in response to persistent stimuli. The long pentraxin PTX3 (pentraxin 3) has emerged as a component of humoral innate immunity with essential functions in the resolution of inflammation, but its role during granuloma formation is unknown. Objectives: To evaluate PTX3 as a modulator of pathogenic signals involved in granuloma formation and inflammation in sarcoidosis. Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from patients with sarcoidosis harboring loss-of-function genetic variants and gene-deleted mice were used to assess the role of PTX3 in experimental models of granuloma formation in vitro and in vivo. The identified mechanisms of granulomatous inflammation were further evaluated in tissue and BAL samples and correlated with the disease course. Measurements and Main Results: We have identified a molecular link between PTX3 deficiency and the pathogenic amplification of complement activation to promote granuloma formation. Mechanistically, PTX3 deficiency licensed the complement component C5a-mediated activation of the metabolic checkpoint kinase mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) and the reprogramming of macrophages toward increased glycolysis to foster their proliferation and aggregation. This process sustained the further recruitment of granuloma-promoting immune cells and the associated proinflammatory microenvironment and influenced the clinical course of the disease. Conclusions: Our results identify PTX3 as a pivotal molecule that regulates complement-mediated signaling cues in macrophages to restrain granulomatous inflammation and highlight the therapeutic potential of this signaling axis in targeting granuloma formation in sarcoidosis.},

	abstract = {Dairy cattle experience a profound nutrient deficit postpartum that is associated with immune dysfunction characterized by heightened inflammation and reduced pathogen clearance. The activation of the central nutrient-sensing mTOR pathway is comparatively reduced in leukocytes of early postpartum dairy cows during this time of most pronounced nutrient deficit. We assessed the effect of pharmacological mTOR inhibition (Torin-1, rapamycin) on differentiation of monocyte derived classically (M1) and alternatively (M2) activated macrophages (MPh) and dendritic cells (moDC) from 12 adult dairy cows. Treatment with mTOR inhibitors generated M1 MPh with increased oxidative burst and expression of IL12 subunits but decreased phagocytosis and expression of IL1B, IL6, and IL10. In M2 MPh, treatment inhibited expression of regulatory features (CD163, ARG2, IL10) skewing the cells toward an M1-like phenotype. In moDC, mTOR inhibition increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL12A, IL12B, IL1B, IL6) and surface CD80. In co-culture with mixed lymphocytes, mTOR-inhibited moDC exhibited a cytokine profile favoring a Th1 response with increased TNF and IFNG production and decreased IL10 concentrations. We conclude that mTOR inhibition in vitro promoted differentiation of inflammatory macrophages with reduced regulatory features and generation of Th1-favoring dendritic cells. These mechanisms could contribute to immune dysregulation in postpartum dairy cows.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies have long demonstrated the association of nutrient status and immune dysfunction in dairy cows. Postpartum dairy cows experiencing a nutrient deficit show a propensity for increased inflammatory response, decreased pathogen clearance, and increased incidence of infectious disease. Studies in cows and other species show that the nutrient sensing mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway could be one potential causal pathway connecting the deficit in nutrient availability and the heightened inflammatory response. Our objective was to investigate the effects of pharmacological mTOR pathway inhibition on phenotype and cytokine expression of bovine monocyte derived dendritic cells (moDC). We differentiated CD14+ monocytes from dairy cows (n = 14) into moDC in the presence or absence of first- or second-generation mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and PP242 (both 100 nM), respectively. On day seven cells were matured with E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 100 ng/mL) or left unstimulated to represent naïve moDC. Surface expression of CD14, CD40, CD80, and MHCII was measured via flow cytometry. We measured mRNA expression of IL10, IL12A, IL12B, and TNFα by rt-qPCR, and protein concentrations of IL-10 and TFN-α in cell culture supernatants with a bead-based multiplex assay. Cultures from ten cows successfully developed the moDC phenotype in culture without inhibitors, defined as increased surface expression of CD40, CD80, and MHCII compared with naïve moDC. Only data from these cows were considered for the results on effects of mTOR inhibitors. In naïve and mature moDC mTOR inhibition increased MHCII expression compared to controls. In mature moDC, in addition to MHCII, CD80 expression was increased compared with untreated LPS-stimulated controls. Expression of IL12A mRNA was upregulated in mature, mTOR inhibited moDC compared with untreated controls. In cell culture supernatants mTOR inhibition reduced IL-10 and increased TNF-α concentrations in naïve and mature moDCs compared with untreated controls. Overall rapamycin had a more consistent effect on altering phenotype and cytokine expression of moDC than PP242. In summary we observed an increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules and antigen presentation potential in mature moDC differentiated under mTOR inhibition, and a cytokine pattern that would potentially favor a Th1 type response. This study provides novel data indicating a role for mTOR signaling in bovine moDC phenotype and mediator profile. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the role of the mTOR pathway in shaping the bovine immune response and may help to provide mechanistic insight and opportunities for modulation of the immune response during the nutrient deficit of early lactation.},

Therefore, the aim of our study was to reevaluate the percentage of S6K activation in sarcoidosis patients in a Dutch cohort. To investigate whether this activation is specific for sarcoid granulomas, we also included Dutch patients with other granulomatous diseases of the lung. The activation of the S6K signaling pathway was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of its downstream effector phospho-S6 in tissue sections. Active S6K signaling was detected in 32 (43\%) of the sarcoidosis patients. Twelve (31\%) of the patients with another granulomatous disorder also showed activated S6K signaling, demonstrating that the mTORC1 pathway may be activated in a range for different granulomatous diseases (p = 0.628). Activation of S6K can only be found in a subgroup of patients with sarcoidosis, as well as in patients with other granulomatous pulmonary diseases, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis or vasculitis. No association between different clinical phenotypes and S6K activation can be found in sarcoidosis.},

However, additional pathways that may regulate PDCD4 expression are largely ill-defined. In this study, we have found that activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 promoted degradation of PDCD4 in macrophages and fibroblasts. Mechanistically, we identified a pathway from p38 and its substrate MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) to the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) to regulate mTORC1-dependent degradation of PDCD4. Moreover, we provide evidence that TSC1 and TSC2 regulate PDCD4 expression via an additional mechanism independent of mTORC1.

In addition, the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 are frequently deregulated and become activated in cancer cells to drive cell transformation, survival, neovascularization, and invasion. In this review, we provide an overview of the influence of mTOR complexes on immune and cancer cell function and metabolism. We discuss how mTOR inhibitors aiming to target cancer cells will influence immunometabolic cell functions participating either in antitumor responses or favoring tumor cell progression in individual immune cells.

We hypothesized that NorUDCA may directly modulate CD8+ T cell function thus contributing to its therapeutic efficacy.
METHODS: NorUDCA's immunomodulatory effects were first studied in Mdr2-/- mice, as a cholestatic model of PSC. To differentiate NorUDCA's immunomodulatory effects on CD8+ T cell function from its anticholestatic actions, we also used a non-cholestatic model of hepatic injury induced by an excessive CD8+ T cell immune response upon acute non-cytolytic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Studies included molecular and biochemical approaches, flow cytometry and metabolic assays in murine CD8+ T cells in vitro. Mass spectrometry was used to identify potential CD8+ T cell targets modulated by NorUDCA. The signaling effects of NorUDCA observed in murine cells were validated in circulating T cells from patients with PSC.
RESULTS: NorUDCA demonstrated immunomodulatory effects by reducing hepatic innate and adaptive immune cells, including CD8+ T cells in the Mdr2-/- model. In the non-cholestatic model of CD8+ T cell-driven immunopathology induced by acute LCMV infection, NorUDCA ameliorated hepatic injury and systemic inflammation. Mechanistically, NorUDCA demonstrated strong immunomodulatory efficacy in CD8+ T cells affecting lymphoblastogenesis, expansion, glycolysis and mTORC1 signaling. Mass spectrometry identified that NorUDCA regulates CD8+ T cells by targeting mTORC1. NorUDCA's impact on mTORC1 signaling was further confirmed in circulating PSC CD8+ T cells.
CONCLUSIONS: NorUDCA has a direct modulatory impact on CD8+ T cells and attenuates excessive CD8+ T cell-driven hepatic immunopathology. These findings are relevant for treatment of immune-mediated liver diseases such as PSC.
LAY SUMMARY: Elucidating the mechanisms by which 24-norursodeoxycholic acid (NorUDCA) works for the treatment of immune-mediated liver diseases, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, is of considerable clinical interest. Herein, we uncovered an unrecognized property of NorUDCA in the immunometabolic regulation of CD8+ T cells, which has therapeutic relevance for immune-mediated liver diseases, including PSC.},

The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway, antagonized by the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), is important for metabolic responses to obesity. We hypothesized that fluctuations in macrophage-intrinsic PI3K activity via PTEN could alter the trajectory of metabolic disease by driving distinct ATM populations. Using mice harbouring macrophage-specific PTEN deletion or bone marrow chimeras carrying additional PTEN copies, we demonstrate that sustained PI3K activity in macrophages preserves metabolic health in obesity by preventing lipotoxicity. Myeloid PI3K signalling promotes a beneficial ATM population characterized by lipid uptake, catabolism and high expression of the scavenger macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO). Dual MARCO and myeloid PTEN deficiencies prevent the generation of lipid-buffering ATMs, reversing the beneficial actions of elevated myeloid PI3K activity in metabolic disease. Thus, macrophage-intrinsic PI3K signalling boosts metabolic health by driving ATM programmes associated with MARCO-dependent lipid uptake.},

These environmental cues are sensed by the mucosa and a vast repertory of immune cells, especially macrophages. A disruption of intestinal homeostasis in terms of barrier interruption can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer, and macrophages have an important role in restoring epithelial function following injury. The mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway senses environmental cues and integrates metabolic responses. It has emerged as an important regulator of intestinal functions in homeostasis and disease.

Using a combined approach of metabolomics, proteomics, mRNA expression analysis, and enzymatic activity measurements, we demonstrate that Tsc2, a negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling, critically influences the cellular activity of macrophages by regulating the enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh) in an mTORC1-dependent manner. More generally, while lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages repress Phgdh activity, IL-4-stimulated macrophages increase the activity of the enzyme required for the expression of key anti-inflammatory molecules and macrophage proliferation.

Systemic arginine restriction improves outcome in multiple murine arthritis models and its removal induces preosteoclast metabolic quiescence, associated with impaired tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle function and metabolite induction. Effects of arginine deprivation on osteoclastogenesis are independent of mTORC1 activity or global transcriptional and translational inhibition. Arginine scarcity also dampens generation of IL-4 induced MGCs. Strikingly, in extracellular arginine absence, both cell types display flexibility as their formation can be restored with select arginine precursors. These data establish how environmental amino acids control the metabolic fate of polykaryons and suggest metabolic ways to manipulate MGC-associated pathologies and bone remodelling.},

Loss of CDK8 is associated with pronounced transcriptional changes, whereas inhibiting CDK8 kinase activity has minimal effects. Gene set enrichment analysis suggests that the mTOR signaling pathway is deregulated in CDK8-deficient cells and, accordingly, these cells are highly sensitive to mTOR inhibitors. Analysis of large cohorts of human ALL and AML patients reveals a significant correlation between the level of CDK8 and of mTOR pathway members. We have synthesized a small molecule YKL-06-101 that combines mTOR inhibition and degradation of CDK8, and induces cell death in human leukemic cells.

However, the activity and function of mTORC2 in distinct cells within malignant tissue in vivo is insufficiently explored. Surprisingly, in primary human and mouse colorectal cancer (CRC) samples, mTORC2 signaling could not be detected in tumor cells. In contrast, only macrophages in tumor-adjacent areas showed mTORC2 activity, which was downregulated in stromal macrophages residing within human and mouse tumor tissues. Functionally, inhibition of mTORC2 by specific deletion of Rictor in macrophages stimulated tumorigenesis in a colitis-associated CRC mouse model. This phenotype was driven by a proinflammatory reprogramming of mTORC2-deficient macrophages that promoted colitis via the cytokine SPP1/osteopontin to stimulate tumor growth. In human CRC patients, high SPP1 levels and low mTORC2 activity in tumor-associated macrophages correlated with a worsened clinical prognosis. Treatment of mice with a second-generation mTOR inhibitor that inhibits mTORC2 and mTORC1 exacerbated experimental colorectal tumorigenesis in vivo. In conclusion, mTORC2 activity is confined to macrophages in CRC and limits tumorigenesis. These results suggest activation but not inhibition of mTORC2 as a therapeutic strategy for colitis-associated CRC.},

	abstract = {Peroxisomes are proposed to play an important role in the regulation of systemic inflammation; however, the functional role of these organelles in inflammatory responses of myeloid immune cells is largely unknown. In this article, we demonstrate that the nonclassical peroxisome proliferator 4-phenyl butyric acid is an efficient inducer of peroxisomes in various models of murine macrophages, such as primary alveolar and peritoneal macrophages and the macrophage cell line RAW264.7, but not in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages. Further, proliferation of peroxisomes blocked the TLR4 ligand LPS-induced proinflammatory response, as detected by the reduced induction of the proinflammatory protein cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12. In contrast, disturbing peroxisome function by knockdown of peroxisomal gene Pex14 or Mfp2 markedly increased the LPS-dependent upregulation of the proinflammatory proteins COX-2 and TNF-α. Specifically, induction of peroxisomes did not affect the upregulation of COX-2 at the mRNA level, but it reduced the half-life of COX-2 protein, which was restored by COX-2 enzyme inhibitors but not by proteasomal and lysosomal inhibitors. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed that various anti-inflammatory lipid mediators (e.g., docosahexaenoic acid) were increased in the conditioned medium from peroxisome-induced macrophages, which blocked LPS-induced COX-2 upregulation in naive RAW264.7 cells and human primary peripheral blood-derived macrophages. Importantly, LPS itself induced peroxisomes that correlated with the regulation of COX-2 during the late phase of LPS activation in macrophages. In conclusion, our findings identify a previously unidentified role for peroxisomes in macrophage inflammatory responses and suggest that peroxisomes are involved in the physiological cessation of macrophage activation.},

Efflux capacity was quantified by incubating human macrophage foam cells with apoB-depleted serum. During a median follow-up of 4.1 years, 423 patients reached the combined primary end point (composite of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke), 410 patients experienced cardiac events, and 561 patients died. Notably, in Cox regression analyses, we found no association of efflux capacity with the combined primary end point (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI], 0.88 to 1.06; P=0.42), cardiac events (HR, 0.92; 95\% CI, 0.83 to 1.02; P=0.11), or all-cause mortality (HR, 0.96; 95\% CI, 0.88 to 1.05; P=0.39).

In addition, we focus on the lipid as well as amino acid metabolisms, through which IFNs exert potent antiviral and immunomodulatory activities. Conversely, the expression of IFNs is controlled by the nutrient sensor mammalian target of rapamycin or by direct reprograming of lipid metabolic pathways.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immunologists often measure several correlated immunological markers, such as concentrations of different cytokines produced by different immune cells and/or measured under different conditions, to draw insights from complex immunological mechanisms. Although there have been recent methodological efforts to improve the statistical analysis of immunological data, a framework is still needed for the simultaneous analysis of multiple, often correlated, immune markers. This framework would allow the immunologists' hypotheses about the underlying biological mechanisms to be integrated.
RESULTS: We present an analytical approach for statistical analysis of correlated immune markers, such as those commonly collected in modern immuno-epidemiological studies. We demonstrate i) how to deal with interdependencies among multiple measurements of the same immune marker, ii) how to analyse association patterns among different markers, iii) how to aggregate different measures and/or markers to immunological summary scores, iv) how to model the inter-relationships among these scores, and v) how to use these scores in epidemiological association analyses. We illustrate the application of our approach to multiple cytokine measurements from 818 children enrolled in a large immuno-epidemiological study (SCAALA Salvador), which aimed to quantify the major immunological mechanisms underlying atopic diseases or asthma. We demonstrate how to aggregate systematically the information captured in multiple cytokine measurements to immunological summary scores aimed at reflecting the presumed underlying immunological mechanisms (Th1/Th2 balance and immune regulatory network). We show how these aggregated immune scores can be used as predictors in regression models with outcomes of immunological studies (e.g. specific IgE) and compare the results to those obtained by a traditional multivariate regression approach.
CONCLUSION: The proposed analytical approach may be especially useful to quantify complex immune responses in immuno-epidemiological studies, where investigators examine the relationship among epidemiological patterns, immune response, and disease outcomes.},

Classic mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin or everolimus are commonly used in transplant as well as cancer patients to prevent transplant rejection or cancer progression, respectively. Noninfectious drug-induced pneumonitis is a frequent side effect in mTOR-inhibitor-treated patients. Therefore, we tested the effects of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus and the novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 in a murine lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury model. C57BL/6 mice were treated with either everolimus or NVP-BEZ235 on two consecutive days prior to intratracheal administration of LPS. LPS administration induced a significant increase in total cell, neutrophil and erythrocyte numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histological examination revealed a serious lung injury as shown by interstitial edema, vascular congestion and mononuclear cell infiltration in these mice after 24h. Everolimus as well as NVP-BEZ235 did not noticeably affect overall histopathology of the lungs in the lung injury model. However, NVP-BEZ235 enhanced IL-6 and TNF-α expression after 24h. In contrast, everolimus did not affect IL-6 and TNF-α levels. Interestingly, both inhibitors reduced inflammatory cytokines in an LPS/oleic acid-induced lung injury model. In conclusion, the mTOR inhibitors did not worsen the overall histopathological severity, but they exerted distinct effects on proinflammatory cytokine expression in the lung depending on the lung injury model applied.},

Cholesterol acceptor capacity and antioxidative activity, representing two key cardioprotective mechanisms of HDL, were profoundly suppressed in kidney transplant recipients independent of graft function and were comparable with levels in patients with ESRD. Using a mass spectroscopy approach, we identified specific remodeling of transplant HDL with highly enriched proteins, including α-1 microglobulin/bikunin precursor, pigment epithelium-derived factor, surfactant protein B, and serum amyloid A.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Impairment of HDL function has been associated with cardiovascular events in patients with kidney failure. The protein composition of HDLs is altered in these patients, presumably compromising the cardioprotective effects of HDLs. This post hoc study assessed the relation of distinct HDL-bound proteins with cardiovascular outcomes in a dialysis population.
DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, \& MEASUREMENTS: The concentrations of HDL-associated serum amyloid A (SAA) and surfactant protein B (SP-B) were measured in 1152 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus on hemodialysis participating in The German Diabetes Dialysis Study who were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment of 20 mg atorvastatin daily or matching placebo. The association of SAA(HDL) and SP-B(HDL) with cardiovascular outcomes was assessed in multivariate regression models adjusted for known clinical risk factors.
RESULTS: High concentrations of SAA(HDL) were significantly and positively associated with the risk of cardiac events (hazard ratio per 1 SD higher, 1.09; 95\% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.19). High concentrations of SP-B(HDL) were significantly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio per 1 SD higher, 1.10; 95\% confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.19). Adjustment for HDL cholesterol did not affect these associations.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with diabetes on hemodialysis, SAA(HDL) and SP-B(HDL) were related to cardiac events and all-cause mortality, respectively, and they were independent of HDL cholesterol. These findings indicate that a remodeling of the HDL proteome was associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with ESRD.},

Here, we describe a rapid and flexible protocol for the isolation of clean and intact nuclei, which results in the recovery of 90-95 \% highly pure nuclei. The method, called lysis gradient centrifugation (LGC), is based on an iso-osmolar discontinuous iodixanol-based density gradient including a detergent-containing lysis layer. A single low g-force centrifugation step enables mild cell lysis and prevents extensive contact of the nuclei with the cytoplasmic environment. This fast method shows high reproducibility due to the relatively little cell manipulation required by the investigator. Further advantages are the low amount of starting material required, easy parallel processing of multiple samples, and isolation of nuclei and cytoplasm at the same time from the same sample.},

Here we used amniotic fluid stem (AFS) cells and focused on the mechanisms occurring during early steps of differentiation along the Schwann cell lineage. Therefore, we initiated Schwann cell differentiation in AFS cells and monitored as well as modulated the activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, the major regulator of anabolic processes. Our results show that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity is essential for glial marker expression and expression of Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein (SREBP) target genes. Moreover, SREBP target gene activation by statin treatment promoted lipogenic gene expression, induced mTORC1 activation and stimulated Schwann cell differentiation. To investigate mTORC1 downstream signaling we expressed a mutant S6K1, which subsequently induced the expression of the Schwann cell marker S100b, but did not affect lipogenic gene expression. This suggests that S6K1 dependent and independent pathways downstream of mTORC1 drive AFS cells to early Schwann cell differentiation and lipogenic gene expression.

Recently, it was shown that rapamycin decreases hepatic LDL receptor (LDL-R) expression, which likely contributes to hypercholesterolemia. Scavenger receptor, class B, type I (SR-BI) is the major HDL receptor and consequently regulating HDL-cholesterol levels and the athero-protective effects of HDL. By using the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, we show that SR-BI is down-regulated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). This reduction of SR-BI protein as well as mRNA levels by about 50\% did not alter HDL particle uptake or HDL-derived lipid transfer. However, rapamycin reduced HDL-induced activation of eNOS and stimulation of endothelial cell migration. The effects on cell migration could be counteracted by SR-BI overexpression, indicating that decreased SR-BI expression is in part responsible for the rapamycin-induced effects. We demonstrate that inhibition of mTOR leads to endothelial cell dysfunction and decreased SR-BI expression, which may contribute to atherogenesis during rapamycin treatment.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are widely utilized in cancer and transplantation, with increased use of these agents expected in future years. Although generally well tolerated, drug-induced pneumonitis (DIP) has been described as a class effect associated with these compounds, especially at higher doses. This toxicity is observed in about a third of cancer patients, although only around 10\% will have symptoms necessitating treatment. Clinical DIP can be effectively managed by early recognition and prompt intervention, including dose reduction and/or treatment cessation. However, little is known about the pathophysiology of this entity and its best management.
AREAS COVERED: This article will review current understanding of the mechanism of DIP, as well as the clinical impact and management of this toxicity in cancer patients treated with mTOR inhibitors. It also provides direction for future research.
EXPERT OPINION: Although guidelines on the management of mTOR inhibitor-associated DIP in cancer patients have been published, these do not always concur or cover all management aspects. Education of patients and healthcare professionals is a key component in managing mTOR inhibitor therapy; assessing the history of pulmonary conditions before the initiation of such a therapy is also essential. Updated diagnostic criteria for pneumonitis might improve our knowledge in the future.},

	abstract = {The innate myeloid immune system is a complex network of cells that protect against disease by identifying and killing pathogens and tumour cells, but it is also implicated in homoeostatic mechanisms such as tissue remodelling and wound healing. Myeloid phagocytes such as monocytes, macrophages or dendritic cells are at the basis of controlling these immune responses in all tissues of the body. In the present review, we summarize recent studies demonstrating that mTOR [mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin] regulates innate immune reactions in macrophages and dendritic cells. The mTOR pathway serves as a decision maker to control the cellular response to pathogens and tumours by regulating the expression of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines or interferons. In addition to various in vivo mouse models, kidney transplant patients under mTOR inhibitor therapy allowed the elucidation of important innate immune functions regulated by mTOR in humans. The role of the mTOR pathway in macrophages and dendritic cells enhances our understanding of the immune system and suggests new therapeutic avenues for the regulation of pro- versus anti-inflammatory mediators with potential relevance to cancer therapy, the design of novel adjuvants and the control of distinct infectious and autoimmune diseases.},

Here, we describe the clinical course of AFib amyloidosis associated with the rare R554L mutation, and the significance of extrarenal amyloid deposits and their possible influence on cardiovascular morbidity.
METHODS: We report on 101 members of a family after having conducted patient interviews, chart review, genetic testing, renal biopsies and assessment for extrarenal amyloid deposition.
RESULTS: Ten family members had chronic kidney disease with late-onset gross proteinuria and a variable course of declining renal function, starting in the fourth decade of life. In two affected living members, we identified the AFib R554L mutation. Renal biopsies from two affected members revealed almost complete obliteration of the mesangial glomerular architecture, although kidney function was only moderately impaired. There was neither evidence of extrarenal amyloidosis nor accelerated atherosclerosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Renal amyloidosis associated with the R554L AFib variant dominated the clinical picture in this family, which was similar to that associated with the much more prevalent E526V mutation. Although it has been hypothesized that vascular deposits of fibrinogen amyloid may be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis, there was no suggestion of this in this particular kindred.},

Cellular stress induced p38α-mediated mTOR activation that was independent of PI3K but dependent on the MAPK-activated protein kinase 2 and on the inhibition of tuberous sclerosis 1 and 2, a negative regulatory complex of mTOR signaling. Remarkably, p38α and PI3K concurrently modulated mTOR to balance IL-12 and IL-10 expression.

Therapeutic inhibition of PDGFRB markedly prolonged survival of NPM-ALK transgenic mice and increased the efficacy of an ALK-specific inhibitor in transplanted NPM-ALK tumors. Notably, inhibition of PDGFRA and PDGFRB in a patient with refractory late-stage NPM-ALK(+) ALCL resulted in rapid, complete and sustained remission.

	doi = {10.1186/1745-6215-13-79},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data generated with the body composition monitor (BCM, Fresenius) show, based on bioimpedance technology, that chronic fluid overload in hemodialysis patients is associated with poor survival. However, removing excess fluid by lowering dry weight can be accompanied by intradialytic and postdialytic complications. Here, we aim at testing the hypothesis that, in comparison to conventional hemodialysis, blood volume-monitored regulation of ultrafiltration and dialysate conductivity (UCR) and/or regulation of ultrafiltration and temperature (UTR) will decrease complications when ultrafiltration volumes are systematically increased in fluid-overloaded hemodialysis patients.
METHODS/DESIGN: BCM measurements yield results on fluid overload (in liters), relative to extracellular water (ECW). In this prospective, multicenter, triple-arm, parallel-group, crossover, randomized, controlled clinical trial, we use BCM measurements, routinely introduced in our three maintenance hemodialysis centers shortly prior to the start of the study, to recruit sixty hemodialysis patients with fluid overload (defined as ≥15\% ECW). Patients are randomized 1:1:1 into UCR, UTR and conventional hemodialysis groups. BCM-determined, 'final' dry weight is set to normohydration weight -7\% of ECW postdialysis, and reached by reducing the previous dry weight, in steps of 0.1 kg per 10 kg body weight, during 12 hemodialysis sessions (one study phase). In case of intradialytic complications, dry weight reduction is decreased, according to a prespecified algorithm. A comparison of intra- and post-dialytic complications among study groups constitutes the primary endpoint. In addition, we will assess relative weight reduction, changes in residual renal function, quality of life measures, and predialysis levels of various laboratory parameters including C-reactive protein, troponin T, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, before and after the first study phase (secondary outcome parameters).
DISCUSSION: Patients are not requested to revert to their initial degree of fluid overload after each study phase. Therefore, the crossover design of the present study merely serves the purpose of secondary endpoint evaluation, for example to determine patient choice of treatment modality. Previous studies on blood volume monitoring have yielded inconsistent results. Since we include only patients with BCM-determined fluid overload, we expect a benefit for all study participants, due to strict fluid management, which decreases the mortality risk of hemodialysis patients.

	abstract = {Uremia impairs the atheroprotective properties of HDL, but the mechanisms underlying why this occurs are unknown. Here, we observed that HDL isolated from healthy individuals inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines by peripheral monocytes stimulated with a Toll-like receptor 2 agonist. In contrast, HDL isolated from the majority of patients with ESRD did not show this anti-inflammatory property; many HDL samples even promoted the production of inflammatory cytokines. To investigate this difference, we used shotgun proteomics to identify 49 HDL-associated proteins in a uremia-specific pattern. Proteins enriched in HDL from patients with ESRD (ESRD-HDL) included surfactant protein B (SP-B), apolipoprotein C-II, serum amyloid A (SAA), and α-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor. In addition, we detected some ESRD-enriched proteins in earlier stages of CKD. We did not detect a difference in oxidation status between HDL isolated from uremic and healthy patients. Regarding function of these uremia-specific proteins, only SAA mimicked ESRD-HDL by promoting inflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, SAA levels in ESRD-HDL inversely correlated with its anti-inflammatory potency. In conclusion, HDL has anti-inflammatory activities that are defective in uremic patients as a result of specific changes in its molecular composition. These data suggest a potential link between the high levels of inflammation and cardiovascular mortality in uremia.},

METHODS: We evaluated the occurrence of cfDNA in HD patients and its functional relevance for innate immunity and inflammation.
RESULTS: Here, we found that cfDNA was enhanced in the plasma of ESRD patients after HD compared to healthy controls. Functionally, cfDNA selectively stimulated the production of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 by human monocytes, whereas tumour necrosis factor-α or IL-10 was not induced. Conversely, plasma from HD patients, but not from healthy controls or DNase I-treated HD plasma, induced IL-6 production from monocytes.
CONCLUSION: We provide the first evidence that cfDNA has selective immunostimulatory effects on human monocytes. This process may contribute to the proinflammatory milieu observed in HD patients.},

Living cells were applied on an iso-osmolar discontinuous iodixanol-based density gradient including a detergent-containing lysis layer. Mild cell lysis as well as efficient washing of the nuclei was performed during the course of one single low g-force centrifugation step. The isolation procedure, which we call lysis gradient centrifugation (LGC), results in the recovery of 90-95\% of highly pure nuclei.

Therefore, organ transplantation is a common therapeutic option in distinct patients with hamartoma syndromes, especially those with TSC/lymphangioleiomyomatosis. mTOR inhibitors are currently used in allogeneic transplantation as immunosuppressants and for the treatment of a growing number of cancers with dysregulated mTOR/phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. This dual targeting provides the unique opportunity for mTOR inhibitors to affect hamartoma syndromes at the molecular level along with potent immunosuppression in transplanted individuals. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of hamartoma syndromes and discuss the recent clinical progress in transplant patients with hamartomas.

	abstract = {A central role for the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in innate immunity has been recently defined by its ability to limit proinflammatory mediators. Although glucocorticoids (GCs) exert potent anti-inflammatory effects in innate immune cells, it is currently unknown whether the mTOR pathway interferes with GC signaling. Here we show that inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin or Torin1 prevented the anti-inflammatory potency of GC both in human monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells. GCs could not suppress nuclear factor-κB and JNK activation, the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and the promotion of Th1 responses when mTOR was inhibited. Interestingly, long-term activation of monocytes with lipopolysaccharide enhanced the expression of TSC2, the principle negative regulator of mTOR, whereas dexamethasone blocked TSC2 expression and reestablished mTOR activation. Renal transplant patients receiving rapamycin but not those receiving calcineurin inhibitors displayed a state of innate immune cell hyper-responsiveness despite the concurrent use of GC. Finally, mTOR inhibition was able to override the healing phenotype of dexamethasone in a murine lipopolysaccharide shock model. Collectively, these data identify a novel link between the glucocorticoid receptor and mTOR in innate immune cells, which is of considerable clinical importance in a variety of disorders, including allogeneic transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.},

More specifically, we will focus on the conspicuous anti-inflammatory properties of HDL as this might contribute to the overall beneficial effects of HDL in diseased patients such as modulation of costimulatory/adhesion molecule expression, cytokine production and inhibition of the prototypical proinflammatory transcription factor NF-κB.
RESULTS: A range of clinical disorders share permanent inflammation as a characteristic hallmark including coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus or rheumatoid arthritis and also display distinct qualitative changes in the HDL compartment. Loss of anti-inflammatory functions of HDL is emerging as an important risk factor for disease progression and survival in these clinical entities.
CONCLUSIONS: It will be important to define the anti-inflammatory effects of HDL at the molecular level and to dissect the manifold functional implications to develop both novel functional assays that enable meaningful outcome studies and foster new therapeutic concepts in patients with altered HDL function.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: New-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (NODAT), a frequent and serious complication after transplantation, is associated with decreased graft and patient survival. Currently, it is diagnosed and treated primarily according to existing guidelines for type II diabetes. To date, only a few trials have studied antidiabetic drugs in patients with NODAT. Vildagliptin is a novel dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that improves pancreatic islet function by enhancing both α- and β-cell responsiveness to increased blood glucose. Experimental data show potential protective effects of DPP-4 inhibitors on islet function after exogenous stress stimuli including immunosuppressants. Therefore, the therapy of NODAT with this class of compounds seems attractive. At present, vildagliptin is used to treat type II diabetes as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs, since that it efficiently decreases glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values. Additionally, vildagliptin has been shown to be safe in patients with moderately impaired kidney function. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of vildagliptin monotherapy in renal transplant recipients with recently diagnosed NODAT.
METHODS/DESIGN: This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, prospective phase II trial. Using the results of routinely performed oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) in stable renal transplant patients at our center, we will recruit patients without a history of diabetes and a 2 h glucose value surpassing 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/l). They are randomized to receive either 50 mg vildagliptin or placebo once daily. A total of 32 patients with newly diagnosed NODAT will be included. The primary endpoint is the difference in the 2 h glucose value between baseline and the repeated OGTT performed 3 months after treatment start, compared between the vildagliptin- and the placebo-group. Secondary endpoints include changes in HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG). The safety of vildagliptin in renal transplant patients will be assessed by the number of symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes (glucose {\textless}72 mg/dl or 4 mmol/l), the number of adverse events, and possible medication-associated side-effects.
DISCUSSION: NODAT is a severe complication after kidney transplantation. Few trials have assessed the safety and efficacy of antidiabetic drugs for these patients. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of vildagliptin in renal transplant patients with NODAT.

	abstract = {The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates cell growth and survival and exists as rapamycin-sensitive mTOR complex (mTORC) 1 and as rapamycin-insensitive mTORC2. Although mTOR is a well-known regulator of diverse immune cells, its detailed role in human dendritic cell (DC) function and differentiation is only incompletely understood. In this study, we demonstrate divergent roles of mTOR during activation and differentiation of myeloid DCs (mDCs) and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). Inhibition of mTORC1 in mDCs activated with TLR-dependent or -independent stimuli increased proinflammatory cytokines and NF-κB, whereas IL-10 and STAT3 were blocked. Rapamycin regulated the costimulatory/surface molecules CD86, programmed death ligand-1, and CD25 on mDCs and significantly increased the T cell allostimulatory potential of mDCs. In contrast, rapamycin suppressed immunostimulatory molecules and the allostimulatory potential of LPS-stimulated moDCs by an inability to augment NF-κB signaling. In differentiating moDCs, the PI3K/Akt-dependent mTOR pathway was constitutively activated by GM-CSF to induce DC differentiation in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Inhibition of mTORC1 or mTORC1/2 during moDC differentiation decreased moDC survival and markedly hampered its immunostimulatory phenotype. Analyzing the fate of DCs in vivo, we found that kidney transplant patients treated with rapamycin displayed an increased immunostimulatory potential of mDCs compared with patients treated with calcineurin inhibitors. Furthermore, rapamycin did not interfere with mDC differentiation in these patients. Collectively, mTOR exerts divergent immunoregulatory functions during DC activation and differentiation depending on the DC type that lead to opposing T cell responses, which might be of clinical importance in transplantation, cancer, and also for novel vaccination strategies.},

Recent reports suggest a possible beneficial role of the mTOR-inhibitor (mTOR-I) sirolimus for TSC; however, safety and efficiency of sirolimus in TSC patients after renal transplantation, both as primary immunosuppressant as well as anti-proliferative agent, are still undefined. Moreover, it is currently unknown whether the TSC mutation affects the primary immune response in these patients. In this article, we report on three TSC patients after renal transplantation who have been converted from a calcineurin-inhibitor (CNI)-based immunosuppression to sirolimus. During 2 years of follow-up, renal allograft function was stable or even improved, and no significant sirolimus-associated side-effects were noted. Beneficial effects of sirolimus against TSC were detected in the skin, along with improved spirometric measurements and an arrest of astrocytoma progression. We show that the inflammatory immune response was significantly altered in TSC patients as compared with controls and sirolimus potently affected both inflammatory cytokine production and vascular endothelial growth factor levels in these patients. Larger studies are warranted to further examine the relationship between clinical parameters and the molecular response to mTOR-inhibition in TSC patients after renal transplantation.},

	doi = {10.1097/TP.0b013e3181d9e1c0},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recipient presensitization represents a major hurdle to successful renal transplantation. Previous case series have suggested that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib directly affects the alloantibody-secreting plasma cells in rejecting allograft recipients. However, the ability of this agent to desensitize nonimmunosuppressed transplant candidates before transplantation is currently unknown.
METHODS: In this analysis, two sensitized hemodialysis patients were selected to receive two subsequent bortezomib cycles. Bortezomib was given at 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Dexamethasone was added to the second cycle to enhance treatment efficiency. Serial immune monitoring included cytotoxic panel reactive antibody testing, Luminex single antigen testing for anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) IgG with or without C4d-fixing capability, and ABO antibody detection.
RESULTS: During a half-year follow-up period, cytotoxic panel reactive antibody decreased from 87\% to 80\% (patient 1) and 37\% to 13\% (patient 2). Patient 1 showed a 40\% reduction in binding intensities of identified Luminex HLA single antigen reactivities and, in parallel, slight reductions in ABO blood group antibody and total immunoglobulin levels. In patient 2, bortezomib did not affect circulating antibody levels in a meaningful way. Both patients showed a more than 50\% reduction in the levels of anti-HLA antibody-triggered C4d deposition to Luminex beads.
CONCLUSION: Our initial experience suggests that, without additional immunosuppressive measures, bortezomib has modest effects on circulating antibodies against HLA or blood group antigens. The reduced levels of antibody-triggered complement fixation, however, imply potential clinical relevance of proteasome inhibition for recipient desensitization.},

	doi = {10.2337/db09-0404},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Obesity is associated with a state of chronic low-grade inflammation mediated by immune cells that are primarily located to adipose tissue and liver. The chronic inflammatory response appears to underlie obesity-induced metabolic deterioration including insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Osteopontin (OPN) is an inflammatory cytokine, the expression of which is strongly upregulated in adipose tissue and liver upon obesity. Here, we studied OPN effects in obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance by targeting OPN action in vivo.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet to induce obesity and were then intravenously treated with an OPN-neutralizing or control antibody. Insulin sensitivity and inflammatory alterations in adipose tissue and liver were assessed.
RESULTS: Interference with OPN action by a neutralizing antibody for 5 days significantly improved insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice. Anti-OPN treatment attenuated liver and adipose tissue macrophage infiltration and inflammatory gene expression by increasing macrophage apoptosis and significantly reducing c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activation. Moreover, we report OPN as a novel negative regulator for the activation of hepatic signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is essential for glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. Consequently, OPN neutralization decreased expression of hepatic gluconeogenic markers, which are targets of STAT3-mediated downregulation.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that antibody-mediated neutralization of OPN action significantly reduces insulin resistance in obesity. OPN neutralization partially decreases obesity-associated inflammation in adipose tissue and liver and reverses signal transduction related to insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis. Hence, targeting OPN could provide a novel approach for the treatment of obesity-related metabolic disorders.},

Low doses of topically applied dexamethasone entirely prevented ear swelling in a contact hypersensitivity model in BALB/c mice, while intraperitoneally injected dexamethasone had no effect on disease progression. Moreover, subcutaneously administered dexamethasone completely inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated lethality in C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, even ultra-high doses of intraperitoneally injected dexamethasone could not prevent endotoxin-induced death.

Conversely, deletion of TSC2, the key negative regulator of mTOR, diminished NF-kappaB but enhanced STAT3 activity and reversed this proinflammatory cytokine shift. Rapamycin-hyperactivated monocytes displayed a strong T helper 1 (Th1) cell- and Th17 cell-polarizing potency. Inhibition of mTOR in vivo regulated the inflammatory response and protected genetically susceptible mice against lethal Listeria monocytogenes infection.

Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional protein involved in various inflammatory processes, cell migration, and tissue remodeling. Because these processes occur in the AT of obese patients, we studied in detail the regulation of OPN expression in human and murine obesity. The study included 20 morbidly obese patients and 20 age- and sex-matched control subjects, as well as two models (diet-induced and genetic) of murine obesity. In high-fat diet-induced and genetically obese mice, OPN expression was drastically up-regulated in AT (40 and 80-fold, respectively) but remained largely unaltered in liver ({\textless}2-fold). Moreover, OPN plasma concentrations remained unchanged in both murine models of obesity, suggesting a particular local but not systemic importance for OPN. OPN expression was strongly elevated also in the AT of obese patients compared with lean subjects in both omental and sc AT. In addition, we detected three OPN isoforms to be expressed in human AT and, strikingly, an obesity induced alteration of the OPN isoform expression pattern. Analysis of AT cellular fractions revealed that OPN is exceptionally highly expressed in AT macrophages in humans and mice. Moreover, OPN expression in AT macrophages was strongly up-regulated by obesity. In conclusion, our data point toward a specific local role of OPN in obese AT. Therefore, OPN could be a critical regulator in obesity induced AT inflammation and insulin resistance.},

	abstract = {Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) is expressed exclusively in the kidney and constitutes the most abundant protein in urine. An important role for THP in antibacterial host defense but also in inflammatory disorders of the urogenital tract has been suggested. In line with this, THP has been shown recently to potently activate macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) via the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway. We show here that THP interacts specifically with surface structures on DC and provides evidence that they are distinct from TLR4. Using retroviral expression cloning, we have identified one such receptor as the scavenger receptor (SR) expressed by endothelial cells I (SREC-I). In addition, we found that two other receptors for acetylated low-density lipoprotein (AcLDL), namely scavenger receptors AI (SR-AI) and Cla-1 (SR-BI), also serve as receptors for THP. SREC-I/THP interaction is of high affinity (16.8+/-6.8 nM), whereas Cla-1 and SR-AI have lower affinities for THP (396 nM+/-114 nM and 802 nM+/-157 nM, respectively). The interaction of THP with these molecules is fully blocked by AcLDL. However, AcLDL only partially blocks binding of THP to DC, and a series of experiments did not support a role in DC activation for SR interacting with THP and AcLDL. Thus, our data point to the existence of additional receptors for THP, which mediate TLR4-dependent DC activation. Interaction and up-take of THP by SR might play an important role in local host defense and could contribute to inflammatory kidney diseases associated with THP-specific antibody responses.},

Here we investigated, whether ATG affects T-cell/APC interactions. ATG concentration and time-dependently inhibited relocalization of the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex as well as adhesion molecules and cytoskeletal proteins of human peripheral blood T-cells and a human T-cell line towards the APC contact site. Moreover, ATG-treated peripheral blood T-cells were incapable to form conjugates with APCs. In conclusion, ATG impairs T-cell/APC conjugate formation, a mechanism that may help to understand the functional inactivation of peripheral blood T-cells that have escaped cellular depletion after ATG treatment.},

	abstract = {A stable supramolecular cluster in T cells at the contact site of APCs, the immunological synapse (IS), is essential for full T cell activation. Failure of IS maturation, as determined by defective relocalization of the TCR/CD3 complex at the T cell/APC contact site, is linked with T cell hyporesponsiveness. The effects of clinically used immunosuppressants on these critical events, however, are undefined. Here, we show that treatment of T cells with cyclosporin A, FK506, and dexamethasone, which are known to inhibit calcineurin and NF-kappaB, respectively, but not rapamycin, the inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin, selectively prevented TCR/CD3 relocalization into the IS, while relocalization of adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins as well as T cell/APC conjugate formation remained unaltered. The involvement of calcineurin and NF-kappaB in IS maturation was confirmed by using specific inhibitors of these molecules (FR901725, gossypol, SN50). FK778, as an inhibitor of DNA replication and also TCR/CD3-activated tyrosine kinases, globally abrogated cytoskeletal, adhesion, and signaling molecule relocalization, thereby preventing formation of an IS at an earlier, immature stage along with impaired, antigen-specific T cell/APC conjugate formation. Collectively, blocking IS formation at distinct stages may mediate effects on T cell activation of currently used immunosuppressants, apart from their capacity to block gene transcription, cytokine signaling, and DNA replication. Furthermore, these data imply novel functions of calcineurin and NF-kappaB for successful IS maturation.},

	abstract = {Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP) is exclusively produced by renal tubular cells of the distal loop of Henle and is the most abundant urinary protein in mammals. The physiological function of THP has remained elusive for over half a century; however, new lines of research position it as a central antimicrobial molecule combating urinary tract infection (UTI). Furthermore, the genetic basis of familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy (FJHN), glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD) and autosomal dominant medullary cystic kidney disease 2 (MCKD2) has been recently attributed to mutations within the THP gene. In these clinical conditions misfolded THP accumulates in the tubular cells, ultimately leading to overt renal insufficiency. UTI is the most common nonepidemic bacterial infection in humans, where both innate and adaptive components of the immune system as well as the bladder epithelium are involved in its prevention and clearance. Since the urogenital tract is devoid of typical physical barriers such as mucus or a ciliated epithelium, soluble mediators with potent anti-bacterial capabilities might exist. Recently, genetic ablation of the THP gene was shown to lead to severe infection and lethal pyelonephritis in experimental models of UTI. In addition, mounting evidence indicates that, beyond simply a direct antimicrobial activity, THP is a potent immunoregulatory molecule that induces specific THP-directed cell-mediated immunity. In light of these novel findings the particular role of THP as a specialized defense molecule in the urinary tract is discussed.},

We demonstrate that THP activates myeloid DCs via Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) to acquire a fully mature DC phenotype. THP triggers typical TLR signaling, culminating in activation of NF-kappaB. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from TLR4- and MyD88-deficient mice were nonresponsive to THP in contrast to those from TLR2- and TLR9-deficient mice. In vivo THP-driven TNF-alpha production was evident in WT but not in Tlr4-/- mice. Importantly, generation of THP-specific Abs consistently detectable in urinary tract inflammation was completely blunted in Tlr4-/- mice.

A library built up from genomic fragments of the virulent S. aureus COL strain (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) allowed us to screen all possible encoded peptides for immunoreactivity. As selective agents, human sera exhibiting a high antibody titer and opsonic activity against S. aureus were used, since these antibodies indicate the in vivo expression and immunoreactivity of the corresponding proteins. Identified clones cluster in distinct regions of 75 genes, most of them classifiable as secreted or surface-localized proteins, including previously identified virulence factors. In addition, 14 putative novel short open reading frames were identified and their immunoreactivity and in vivo mRNA expression were confirmed, underscoring the annotation-independent, true genomic nature of our approach. Evidence is provided that a large fraction of the identified peptides cannot be expressed in an in vivo-based surface display system. Thus, in vitro protein selection, not biased by the context of living entities, allows screening of genomic expression libraries with a large number of different ligands simultaneously. It is a powerful approach for fingerprinting the repertoire of immune reactive proteins serving as target candidates for active and passive vaccination against pathogens.},

METHODS: All patients with pSS and renal involvement who were admitted to Ruijin Hospital from April 1993 to December 2006 were included. All the data of clinical features and pathological changes were retrospectively analyzed. Forty-one patients underwent renal biopsies. RESULTS Our study included 130 patients with pSS: 122 women and 8 men. Ages ranged from 16 to 68 years (mean 44.1 +/- 11.52). Ninety-five patients (73.1\%) developed renal tubular acidosis (RTA); 91 were found to have distal RTA. Nine patients presented with hypokalemic paralysis. Four patients developed Fanconi syndrome and 3 were proved to have nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Twenty-seven of 130 patients (20.8\%) developed tubular proteinuria and 18/130 (13.8\%) presented glomerular involvement. Thirty-five patients (27.7\%) developed renal failure (serum creatinine {\textgreater} 115 micromol/l). Most patients (70.8\%) had increased serum IgG levels. The incidence of chronic interstitial nephritis was 80.5\% among all the biopsy materials. Immunofluorescent staining was negative in most renal tissue. Ninety-six patients were treated with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressant. Eighteen recovered renal function. CONCLUSION: Patients with pSS commonly present with renal impairment, mainly from renal tubular dysfunction. The combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressors significantly improves the renal function of patients with pSS. There is a correlation between hypergammaglobulinemia and distal RTA. The renal acidification capacity for patients with hypergammaglobulinemia. should be monitored.},

Secondary renal amyloidosis with history of pulmonary tuberculosis is rare in CVID, although T cell dysfunction has been reported in few CVID patients. A 40-year-old male was admitted to our hospital with a 3-month history of recurrent respiratory infections and persistent pitting pedal edema. His past history revealed 3 to 5 episodes of recurrent respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea each year since last 20 years. He had been successfully treated for sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis 8 years back. Laboratory studies disclosed high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), hypoalbuminemia and nephrotic range proteinuria. Serum immunoglobulin levels were low. CD4/CD8 ratio and CD3 level was normal. C3 and C4 complement levels were normal. Biopsy revealed amyloid A (AA) positive secondary renal amyloidosis. Glomeruli showed variable widening of mesangial regions with deposition of periodic schiff stain (PAS) pale positive of pink matrix showing apple green birefringence on Congo-red staining. Immunohistochemistry was AA stain positive. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed no staining with anti-human IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, C1q, kappa and lambda light chains antisera. Patient was treated symptomatically for respiratory tract infection and was discharged with low dose angiotensin receptor blocker. An old treated tuberculosis and chronic inflammation due to recurrent respiratory tract infections were thought to be responsible for AA amyloidosis. Thus pulmonary tuberculosis should be considered in differential diagnosis of secondary causes of AA renal amyloidosis in patients of CVID especially in endemic settings.},

Secondary amyloidosis is an uncommon complication of CVID. We report an unusual case of a 27-year-old male patient who presented with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, chronic diarrhea, and hypogammaglobulinemia and was diagnosed with CVID. The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy once every 21 days and daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for prophylaxis. Two years after initial diagnosis, the patient was found to have progressive decline in IgG levels (as low as 200–300 mg/dL) despite regular Ig infusions. The laboratory tests revealed massive proteinuria and his kidney biopsy showed accumulation of AA type amyloid. We believe that the delay in the diagnosis of CVID and initiation of Ig replacement therapy caused chronic inflammation due to recurrent infections in our patient and this led to an uncommon and life-threatening complication, amyloidosis. Patients with CVID require regular follow-up for the control of infections and assessment of adequacy of Ig replacement therapy. Amyloidosis should be kept in the differential diagnosis when managing patients with CVID.},

While granulomas are pathologically diverse, their tissue-wide heterogeneity has not been spatially resolved at the single-cell level in human tissues. By spatially mapping individual immune cells in every lesion across entire tissue sections, we report that in addition to necrotizing granulomas, the human TB lung contains abundant non-necrotizing leukocyte aggregates surrounding areas of necrotizing tissue. These cellular lesions were more diverse in composition than necrotizing lesions and could be stratified into four general classes based on cellular composition and spatial distribution of B cells and macrophages. The cellular composition of non-necrotizing structures also correlates with their proximity to necrotizing lesions, indicating these are foci of distinct immune reactions adjacent to necrotizing granulomas. Together, we show that during TB, diseased lung tissue develops a histopathological superstructure comprising at least four different types of non-necrotizing cellular aggregates organized as satellites of necrotizing granulomas.},

Thus, understanding drivers and regulators of granuloma formation is important for improving tuberculosis diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Yet, molecular mechanisms underpinning granuloma formation and dynamics remain poorly understood. Here we used low-dose Mtb infection of C57BL/6 mice, which elicits structured lung granulomas composed of central macrophage clusters encased by a lymphocyte mantle, alongside the disorganized lymphocyte and macrophage clusters commonly observed in Mtb-infected mice. Using gene-deficient mice, we observed that Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and the TLR-related Radioprotective 105 kDa protein (RP105) contributed to the extent and spatial positioning of pathology in infected lung tissues, consistent with functional cooperation between TLR2 and RP105 in the innate immune recognition of Mtb. In mice infected with the highly virulent Mtb clinical isolate HN878, TLR2, but not RP105, positively regulated the extent of central macrophage regions within structured granulomas. Moreover, RP105, but not TLR2, promoted the formation of structured lung granulomas, suggesting that the functions of RP105 as an innate immune sensor for Mtb reach beyond its roles as TLR2 co-receptor. TLR2 and RP105 contributions to lung pathology are governed by Mtb biology, as neither receptor affected the frequency or architecture of structured granulomas in mice infected with the reference strain Mtb H37Rv. Thus, by revealing distinctive as well as cooperative functions of TLR2 and RP105 in lung pathology, our data identify TLRs as molecular determinants of TB granuloma formation and architecture, and expand understanding of how interactions between innate immune receptors and Mtb shape TB disease manifestation.},

	abstract = {Crystalline silica is an important cause of serious pulmonary diseases, and its toxic potential is known to be associated with its surface electrical properties. However, in vivo data clarifying the relevance of silica's toxic potential, especially its long-term effects, remain insufficient. To investigate the contribution of physico-chemical property including surface potential on the hazard of nanocrystalline silica, we performed single intratracheal instillation testing using five different crystalline silicas in a rat model and assessed time-course changes in pulmonary inflammation, lung burden, and thoracic lymph node loads. Silica-nanoparticles were prepared from two commercial products (Min-U-Sil5 [MS5] and SIO07PB [SPB]) using three different pretreatments: centrifugation (C), grinding (G), and surface dissolving (D). The five types of silica particles-MS5, MS5\_C, SPB\_C, SPB\_G, and SPB\_D-were intratracheally instilled into male F344 rats at doses of 0 mg/kg (purified water), 0.22 mg/kg (SPB), and 0.67, 2, or 6 mg/kg (MS5). Bronchoalveolar lavage, a lung burden analysis, and histopathological examination were performed at 3, 28, and 91 days after instillation. Granuloma formation was present in MS5 group at 91 days after instillation, although granuloma formation was suppressed in MS5\_C group, which had a smaller particle size. SPB\_C induced severe and progressive inflammation and kinetic lung overload, whereas SPB\_G and SPB\_D induced only slight and transient acute inflammation. Our results support that in vivo toxic potential of nanosilica by intratracheal instillation may involve with surface electrical properties leading to prolonged effect and may not be dependent not only on surface properties but also on other physico-chemical properties.},

The bacterial pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yp) blocks innate inflammatory signalling and immune defence, inducing neutrophil-rich pyogranulomas (PGs) within lymphoid tissues. Here we uncover that Yp also triggers PG formation within the murine intestinal mucosa. Mice lacking circulating monocytes fail to form defined PGs, have defects in neutrophil activation and succumb to Yp infection. Yersinia lacking virulence factors that target actin polymerization to block phagocytosis and reactive oxygen burst do not induce PGs, indicating that intestinal PGs form in response to Yp disruption of cytoskeletal dynamics. Notably, mutation of the virulence factor YopH restores PG formation and control of Yp in mice lacking circulating monocytes, demonstrating that monocytes override YopH-dependent blockade of innate immune defence.

Despite the benign nature of this neoplasia, the lesions can rapidly grow and become large, painful, invasive, and destructive. The identification of molecular drivers could help in the selection of targeted therapies for specific cases. TRPV4, KRAS and FGFR1 mutations have been associated with these lesions but no correlation between the mutations and patient features was observed so far. In this study, we analysed 17 CGCG cases of an Italian cohort and identified an interesting and significant (p=0.0021) correlation between FGFR1 mutations and age. In detail, FGFR1 mutations were observed frequently and exclusively in CGCG from young ({\textless}18 years old) patients (4/5 lesions, 80\%). Furthermore, the combination between ours and previously published data confirmed a significant difference in the frequency of FGFR1 mutations in CGCG from patients younger than 18 years at the time of diagnosis (9/23 lesions, 39\%) when compared to older patients (1/31 lesions, 0.03\%; p=0.0011), thus corroborating our observation in a cohort of 54 patients. FGFR1 variants in young CGCG patients could favour fast lesion growth, implying that they seek medical attention earlier. Our observation might help prioritise candidates for FGFR1 testing, thus opening treatment options with FGFR inhibitors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Granuloma annulare (GA) and sarcoidosis are granulomatous inflammatory diseases that share similarities.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the histological and immunohistochemical (IHC) features of GA and sarcoidosis.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 36 patients with GA and 26 with sarcoidosis was performed. Results from hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) staining and IHC staining of MMP-9 and pSTAT1 within the skin lesions of GA and sarcoidosis were analyzed, and random forest was applied for developing a predictive model.
RESULTS: Significantly greater expressions of MMP-9 (especially in elastic fibers, EFs, P {\textless} 0.0001) and pSTAT1 (P = 0.0003) were observed in lesion samples of GA versus sarcoidosis patients. In GA patients, MMP-9 was significantly upregulated in the interstitial type (P = 0.0222), while staining of pSTAT1 was positively correlated with the area of mucinous collagen in palisading GA (R = 0.5356, P = 0.0484). In sarcoidosis patients, MMP-9 (R = -0.7127, P = 0.0009) and pSTAT1 (R = -0.5604, P = 0.0067) were found to show stronger expressions in lesions with less lymphocyte infiltration. The predictive model demonstrated an AUC of 0.9675.
CONCLUSION: These results indicate that MMP-9 and pSTAT1 might exert roles in granulomatous inflammation in different modes, and the presence of more robust MMP-9 staining in EFs appears to be more suggestive of GA.},

To better understand granuloma formation, we performed single-cell sequencing and spatial transcriptomics on granulomas from patients with sarcoidosis and bioinformatically reconstructed the underlying gene regulatory networks. We discovered an immune stimulatory environment in granulomas that repurposes transcriptional programs associated with lymphoid organ development. Granuloma formation followed characteristic spatial patterns and involved genes linked to immunometabolism, cytokine and chemokine signaling, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Three cell types emerged as key players in granuloma formation: metabolically reprogrammed macrophages, cytokine-producing Th17.1 cells, and fibroblasts with inflammatory and tissue-remodeling phenotypes. Pharmacological inhibition of one of the identified processes attenuated granuloma formation in a sarcoidosis mouse model. We show that human granulomas adopt characteristic aspects of normal lymphoid organ development in aberrant combinations, indicating that granulomas constitute aberrant lymphoid organs.},

We apply single-cell transcriptomics to investigate macrophage functional diversity during persistent S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) infection in mice. We identify determinants of macrophage heterogeneity in infected spleens and describe populations of distinct phenotypes, functional programming, and spatial localization. Using an STm mutant with impaired ability to polarize macrophage phenotypes, we find that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) defines a granuloma macrophage population that is nonpermissive for intracellular bacteria, and their abundance anticorrelates with tissue bacterial burden. Disruption of pathogen control by neutralizing TNF is linked to preferential depletion of ACE+ macrophages in infected tissues. Thus, ACE+ macrophages have limited capacity to serve as cellular niche for intracellular bacteria to establish persistent infection.},

Here, we use the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum infection model to define the signaling basis of the host angiogenic response. Through intravital imaging and cell-restricted peptide-mediated inhibition, we identify macrophage-specific activation of NFAT signaling as essential to TDM-mediated angiogenesis in vivo. Exposure of cultured human cells to Mycobacterium tuberculosis results in robust induction of VEGFA, which is dependent on a signaling pathway downstream of host TDM detection and culminates in NFATC2 activation.

	abstract = {Paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) may present as an acute/subacute clinical form, characterized by a progressive disease arising from the airborne initial infection, or, most often, as an asymptomatic or subclinical infection that may manifest later during an individual's life, the chronic form. Epidemiological studies show the existence of a strong association between smoking and the development of the chronic form. Current evidence demonstrates that cigarette smoke (CS) has immunosuppressive properties that could be implicated in the increasing susceptibility to the chronic form of PCM. To address this issue, we developed a murine model of a non-progressive pulmonary form of PCM that was exposed to CS at a magnitude that mimicked a moderate smoker. The chronic CS exposure started after 2 weeks and lasted up until 20 weeks post-infection, with the aim of mimicking human natural history, since it is estimated that individuals from endemic areas are infected early in life. The control group consisted of infected but not CS-exposed mice. We assessed the lung fungal burden (colony forming units [CFU]) and the area affected by the granulomatous inflammatory response, fungal dissemination to spleen and liver, and, by immunohistochemistry, the presence of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes, CD68 and MAC-2 macrophages, and IFN-γ, IL-10 and TNF expressing cells within the granulomatous response. We detected a CS effect as early as 2 weeks after exposure (four weeks post-infection) when the lung CFU of exposed animals was significantly higher than in their non-exposed counterparts. At 12 weeks, the CS-exposed animals presented a more severe disease, as witnessed by the persistent higher lung fungal load (although it did not reach statistical significance [ p = 0.054]), greater dissemination to other organs, greater affected area of the lung, decreased IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio, and higher TNF expression within the granulomas, compared with CS-non-exposed mice. The number of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes infiltrating the granulomas was similar between both mice groups, but there was a decrease in the number of MAC-2+ macrophages. No difference was noted in the CD68+ macrophage number. However, the follow-up in week 20 showed that the immunological effects of exposure to CS ceased, with both CS and NCS mice showing the same infectious features, i.e., a trend for resolution of the infection. In conclusion, we show that chronic CS-exposure alters the course of the disease in an experimental model of subclinical pulmonary PCM, confirming the epidemiological link between CS-exposure and the chronic form of PCM. However, we also show that this effect is transitory, being detected between 4- and 12-weeks post-infection but not thereafter. The possible immune mechanisms that mediate this effect and the reasons for its transitory effect are discussed.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Hyaluronic acid is a safe dermal filler, but sometimes late granuloma is generated. This adverse effect is an inflammatory process, and its causes are not clear. Late granuloma generation could be due to the reaction to residual components of the bacterial wall present into hyaluronic acid, such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA). Other possibility is hyaluronic acid degraded could be trigger this inflammatory reaction.
OBJECTIVE: Study possible molecular mechanism that could be implicated into the late granuloma formation. We wonder whereas inflammatory response activation is triggered by lower molecular weight hyaluronic acid or Gram-positive bacterial components as LTA.
METHODS: We analyzed one adverse case generated by hyaluronic acid injections. Our study with one nodule through chemical and immunofluorescence histologic technics.
RESULTS: In this case, observe a late granuloma without infectious process. Histological analysis shown few large Langerhans cells around fillers and multiple immunological cells infiltrated. Immunofluorescent study shown immunological cells (CD45 positives cells) with high TLR2 expression (hyaluronic acid and LTA receptor).
LIMITATIONS: The difficulty of obtaining biopsy samples of nodules implies that the number of cases analyzed is very low.
CONCLUSION: New model is proposed in which weight of hyaluronic acid and LTA could be able to trigger inflammation. This process could be mediated by TLR2 expressed in infiltrated immune cells.},

The characteristic granulomatous-like inflammation poses as the major setback to effective antifungal therapies by limiting drug access to fungi. These inflammatory lung structures are reported to be severely hypoxic; nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms whereby these processes contribute to fungal persistence remain largely unknown. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), besides being the major cellular response regulator to hypoxia, is a known central immune modulator. Here, we used a model of Aspergillus fumigatus airway infection in myeloid-restricted HIF-1α knock-out (mHif1α-/- ) mice to replicate the complex structures resembling fungal granulomas and evaluate the contribution of HIF-1α to antifungal immunity and disease development. We found that fungal-elicited granulomas in mHif1α-/- mice had significantly smaller areas, along with extensive hyphal growth and increased lung fungal burden. This phenotype was associated with defective neutrophil recruitment and an increased neutrophil death, therefore highlighting a central role for HIF-1α-mediated regulation of neutrophil function in the pathogenesis of chronic fungal infection. These results hold the promise of an improved capacity to manage the progression of chronic fungal disease and open new avenues for additional therapeutic targets and niches of intervention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiac involvement is an important determinant of mortality among sarcoidosis patients. Although granulomatous inflammation is a hallmark finding in cardiac sarcoidosis, the precise immune cell populations that comprise the granuloma remain unresolved. Furthermore, it is unclear how the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of cardiac sarcoidosis differs from other inflammatory heart diseases.
METHODS: We leveraged spatial transcriptomics (GeoMx digital spatial profiler) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing to elucidate the cellular and transcriptional landscape of cardiac sarcoidosis. Using GeoMX digital spatial profiler technology, we compared the transcriptomal profile of CD68+ rich immune cell infiltrates in human cardiac sarcoidosis, giant cell myocarditis, and lymphocytic myocarditis. We performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of human cardiac sarcoidosis to identify immune cell types and examined their transcriptomic landscape and regulation. Using multichannel immunofluorescence staining, we validated immune cell populations identified by single-nucleus RNA sequencing, determined their spatial relationship, and devised an immunostaining approach to distinguish cardiac sarcoidosis from other inflammatory heart diseases.
RESULTS: Despite overlapping histological features, spatial transcriptomics identified transcriptional signatures and associated pathways that robustly differentiated cardiac sarcoidosis from giant cell myocarditis and lymphocytic myocarditis. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed the presence of diverse populations of myeloid cells in cardiac sarcoidosis with distinct molecular features. We identified GPNMB (transmembrane glycoprotein NMB) as a novel marker of multinucleated giant cells and predicted that the MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) family of transcription factors regulated this cell type. We also detected additional macrophage populations in cardiac sarcoidosis including HLA-DR (human leukocyte antigen-DR)+ macrophages, SYTL3 (synaptotagmin-like protein 3)+ macrophages and CD163+ resident macrophages. HLA-DR+ macrophages were found immediately adjacent to GPMMB+ giant cells, a distinct feature compared with other inflammatory cardiac diseases. SYTL3+ macrophages were located scattered throughout the granuloma and CD163+ macrophages, CD1c+ dendritic cells, nonclassical monocytes, and T cells were located at the periphery and outside of the granuloma. Finally, we demonstrate mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway activation is associated with proliferation and is selectively found in HLA-DR+ and SYLT3+ macrophages.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we identified diverse populations of immune cells with distinct molecular signatures that comprise the sarcoid granuloma. These findings provide new insights into the pathology of cardiac sarcoidosis and highlight opportunities to improve diagnostic testing.},

Foamy macrophages (FM) are a hallmark of TB granulomas, because they provide the primary platform of M. tuberculosis proliferation and the main source of caseous necrosis. In this study, we applied spatial multiomic profiling to identify the signatures of FM within the necrotic granulomas developed in a mouse model resembling human TB histopathology. C3HeB/FeJ mice were infected with M. tuberculosis to induce the formation of necrotic granulomas in the lungs. Using laser microdissection, necrotic granulomas were fractionated into three distinct regions, including the central caseous necrosis, the rim containing FM, and the peripheral layer of macrophages and lymphocytes, and subjected to proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. Comparison of proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of three distinct granulomatous regions revealed that four proteins/genes are commonly enriched in the rim region. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the localization of identified signatures to the rim of necrotic granulomas. We also investigated the localization of the representative markers for M1 macrophages in granulomas because the signatures of the rim included M2 macrophage markers. The localization of both macrophage markers suggests that FM in necrotic granulomas possessed the features of M1 or M2 macrophages. Gene set enrichment analysis of transcriptomic profiling revealed the upregulation of genes related to M2 macrophage activation and mTORC1 signaling in the rim. These results will provide new insights into the process of FM biogenesis, leading to further understanding of the pathophysiology of TB granulomas.},

Cytokine-mediated signaling can modulate immune function; thus, understanding the cytokine milieu in granulomas is critical for understanding immunity in tuberculosis (TB). Interferons (IFNs) are important immune mediators in TB, and while type 1 and 2 IFNs have been extensively studied, less is known about type 3 IFNs (IFNλs) in TB. To determine if IFNλs are expressed in granulomas, which cells express them, and how granuloma microenvironments influence IFNλ expression, we investigated IFNλ1 and IFNλ4 expression in macaque lung granulomas. We identified IFNλ expression in granulomas, and IFNλ levels negatively correlated with bacteria load. Macrophages and neutrophils expressed IFNλ1 and IFNλ4, with neutrophils expressing higher levels of each protein. IFNλ expression varied in different granuloma microenvironments, with lymphocyte cuff macrophages expressing more IFNλ1 than epithelioid macrophages. IFNλ1 and IFNλ4 differed in their subcellular localization, with IFNλ4 predominantly localizing inside macrophage nuclei. IFNλR1 was also expressed in granulomas, with intranuclear localization in some cells. Further investigation demonstrated that IFNλ signaling is driven in part by TLR2 ligation and was accompanied by nuclear translocation of IFNλR1. Our data indicate that IFNλs are part of the granuloma cytokine milieu that may influence myeloid cell function and immunity in TB.},

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis is a serious and widespread parasitic disease caused by infection with Schistosoma. Because the parasite's eggs are primarily responsible for schistosomiasis dissemination and pathogenesis, inhibiting egg production is a potential approach to control the spread and severity of the disease. The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins represent promising targets for the development of epigenetic drugs against Schistosoma. JQ-1 is a selective inhibitor of the BET protein family. In the present study, JQ-1 was applied to S. japonicum in vitro. By using laser confocal scanning microscopy and EdU incorporation assays, we showed that application of JQ-1 to worms in vitro affected egg laying and the development of both the male and female reproductive systems. JQ-1 also inhibited the expression of the reproductive-related genes SjPlk1 and SjNanos1 in S. japonicum. Mice infected with S. japonicum were treated with JQ-1 during egg granuloma formation. JQ-1 treatment significantly reduced the size of the liver granulomas and levels of serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in mice and suppressed both egg laying and the development of male and female S. japonicum reproductive systems in vivo. Moreover, the mRNA expression levels of some proinflammatory cytokines were decreased in the parasites. Our findings suggest that JQ-1 treatment attenuates S. japonicum egg-induced hepatic granuloma due at least in part to suppressing the development of the reproductive system and egg production of S. japonicum. These findings further suggest that JQ-1 or other BET inhibitors warrant additional study as a new approach for the treatment or prevention of schistosomiasis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Improved access and treatment are critical to controlling the problem. Molecular diagnostic tests, although available, are not feasible in developing countries. Where available, these tests require state-of-the-art laboratories and are not cheap. One alternative to molecular diagnostics is the use of acute phase protein values. This protein is a protein whose levels will increase or decrease in plasma in response to injury or inflammation.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the kinetics of granulomas and the role of IFN-γ and IP-10 in the pathology of tuberculosis in a rat model.
METHODS: Sixty Wistar rats were divided into four groups, namely the control group (without MTB induction) and the MTB-induced group (observations at week-3, week-6, and week-12 post infection). Induce tuberculosis with bacterial strain H37Rv ATCC 27294.
RESULTS: The number and size of the granuloma increased to a peak at week 6 and was consistent for weeks 6 and 12 post-infection. The kinetics of granulomas were consistent with IFN-γ and IP-10 levels.
CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the model of tuberculosis infection by the H37Rv ATCC 27294 strain in Wistar rat found granuloma characteristics and IFN-γ and IP-10 patterns in similar kinetics, so that there was involvement of these molecules in TB pathology. Thus, tuberculosis infection of the H37Rv ATCC 27294 strain in rats can serve as a model for rapid tuberculosis study and display a complete pathological phase.},

These lesions are genetically characterized by mutually exclusive somatic mutations at TRPV4, KRAS, and FGFR1, and a fourth molecular subgroup which is wild-type for the three mutations. Irrespective of the molecular background, giant cell granulomas show MAPK/ERK activation. However, it remains unclear if these mutations lead to differences in their molecular signaling in giant cell granulomas.
METHODS: Metabolomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics analyses were carried out in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of giant cell granuloma of the jaws. The study cohort consisted of five lesions harboring mutations in FGFR1, six in KRAS, five in TRPV4, and five that were wild-type for these mutations.
RESULTS: Lesions harboring KRAS or FGFR1 mutations showed overall similar proteomics and metabolomics profiles. In all four groups, metabolic pathways showed similarity in apoptosis, cell signaling, gene expression, cell differentiation, and erythrocyte activity. Lesions harboring TRPV4 mutations showed a greater number of enriched pathways related to tissue architecture. On the other hand, the wild-type group presented increased number of enriched pathways related to protein metabolism compared to the other groups.

Differing stress response strategies used by different strains of Mtb could influence virulence. Objectives: We compared the virulence of two strains of Mtb with use in animal model research: CDC1551 and Erdman. Methods: Rhesus macaques, which develop human-like tuberculosis attributes and pathology, were infected with a high dose of either strain via aerosol, and virulence was compared by bacterial burden and pathology. Measurements and Main Results: Infection with Erdman resulted in significantly shorter times to euthanasia and higher bacterial burdens and greater systemic inflammation and lung pathology relative to those infected with CDC1551. Macaques infected with Erdman also exhibited significantly higher early inflammatory myeloid cell influx to the lung, greater macrophage and T cell activity, and higher expression of lung remodeling (extracellular matrix) genes, consistent with greater pathology. Expression of NOTCH4 (neurogenic locus notch homolog 4) signaling, which is induced in response to hypoxia and promotes undifferentiated cellular state, was also higher in Erdman-infected lungs. The granulomas generated by Erdman, and not CDC1551, infection appeared to have larger regions of necrosis, which is strongly associated with hypoxia. To better understand the mechanisms of differential hypoxia induction by these strains, we subjected both to hypoxia in vitro. Erdman induced higher concentrations of DosR regulon relative to CDC1551. The DosR regulon is the global regulator of response to hypoxia in Mtb and critical for its persistence in granulomas. Conclusions: Our results show that the response to hypoxia is a critical mediator of virulence determination in Mtb, with potential impacts on bacillary persistence, reactivation, and efficiency of therapeutics.},

	abstract = {Individuals co-infected with HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are more likely to develop severe tuberculosis (TB) disease than HIV-naive individuals. To understand how a chronic pre-existing Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection impairs the early immune response to Mtb, we used the Mauritian cynomolgus macaque (MCM) model of SIV/Mtb co-infection. We examined the relationship between peripheral viral control and Mtb burden, Mtb dissemination, and T cell function between SIV+ spontaneous controllers, SIV+ non-controllers, and SIV-naive MCM who were challenged with a barcoded Mtb Erdman strain 6 months post-SIV infection and necropsied 6 weeks post-Mtb infection. Mycobacterial burden was highest in the SIV+ non-controllers in all assessed tissues. In lung granulomas, the frequency of TNF-α-producing CD4+ T cells was reduced in all SIV+ MCM, but IFNγ-producing CD4+ T cells were only lower in the SIV+ non-controllers. Further, while all SIV+ MCM had more PD1+ and TIGIT+ T cells in the lung granulomas relative to SIV-naive MCM, SIV+ controllers exhibited the highest frequency of cells expressing these markers. To measure the effect of SIV infection on within-host bacterial dissemination, we sequenced the molecular barcodes of Mtb present in each tissue and characterized the Mtb population complexity. While Mtb population complexity was not associated with SIV infection group, lymph nodes had increased complexity when compared with lung granulomas across all groups. These results provide evidence that SIV+ animals, independent of viral control, exhibit a dysregulated T cell immune response and enhanced dissemination of Mtb, likely contributing to the poor TB disease course across all SIV/Mtb co-infected animals. IMPORTANCE HIV and TB remain significant global health issues, despite the availability of treatments. Individuals with HIV, including those who are virally suppressed, are at an increased risk to develop and succumb to severe TB disease when compared with HIV-naive individuals. Our study aims to understand the relationship between the extent of SIV replication, mycobacterial growth, and T cell function in the tissues of co-infected Mauritian cynomolgus macaques during the first 6 weeks of Mtb infection. Here we demonstrate that increased viral replication is associated with increased bacterial burden in the tissues and impaired T cell responses, and that the immunological damage attributed to virus infection is not fully eliminated when animals spontaneously control virus replication.},

	abstract = {The Mycobacterium tuberculosis-harboring granuloma with a necrotic center surrounded by a fibrous capsule is the hallmark of tuberculosis (TB). For a successful treatment, antibiotics need to penetrate these complex structures to reach their bacterial targets. Hence, animal models reflecting the pulmonary pathology of TB patients are of particular importance to improve the preclinical validation of novel drug candidates. M. tuberculosis-infected interleukin-13-overexpressing (IL-13tg) mice develop a TB pathology very similar to patients and, in contrast to other mouse models, also share pathogenetic mechanisms. Accordingly, IL-13tg animals represent an ideal model for analyzing the penetration of novel anti-TB drugs into various compartments of necrotic granulomas by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MS imaging). In the present study, we evaluated the suitability of BALB/c IL-13tg mice for determining the antibiotic distribution within necrotizing lesions. To this end, we established a workflow based on the inactivation of M. tuberculosis by gamma irradiation while preserving lung tissue integrity and drug distribution, which is essential for correlating drug penetration with lesion pathology. MALDI-MS imaging analysis of clofazimine, pyrazinamide, and rifampicin revealed a drug-specific distribution within different lesion types, including cellular granulomas, developing in BALB/c wild-type mice, and necrotic granulomas in BALB/c IL-13tg animals, emphasizing the necessity of preclinical models reflecting human pathology. Most importantly, our study demonstrates that BALB/c IL-13tg mice recapitulate the penetration of antibiotics into human lesions. Therefore, our workflow in combination with the IL-13tg mouse model provides an improved and accelerated evaluation of novel anti-TB drugs and new regimens in the preclinical stage.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is characterized by asthma-like attacks in its early stage, which is easily misdiagnosed as severe asthma. Therefore, new biomarkers for the early diagnosis of EGPA are needed, especially for differentiating the diagnosis of asthma.
OBJECTIVES: To identify serum biomarkers that can be used for early diagnosis of EGPA and to distinguish EGPA from severe asthma.
METHOD: Data-independent acquisition (DIA) analysis was performed to identify 45 healthy controls (HC), severe asthma (S-A), and EGPA patients in a cohort to screen biomarkers for early diagnosis of EGPA and to differentiate asthma diagnosis. Subsequently, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis was applied to a validation cohort of 71 HC, S-A, and EGPA patients.
RESULT: Four candidate biomarkers were identified from DIA and PRM analysis-i.e., serum amyloid A1 (SAA1), fibrinogen-α (FGA), and serum amyloid P component (SAP)-and were upregulated in the EGPA group, while cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) was downregulated in the EGPA group compared with the S-A group. Receiver operating characteristics analysis shows that, as biomarkers for early diagnosis of EGPA, the combination of SAA1, FGA, and SAP has an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.947, a sensitivity of 82.35\%, and a specificity of 100\%. The combination of SAA1, FGA, SAP, and CETP as biomarkers for differential diagnosis of asthma had an AUC of 0.921, a sensitivity of 78.13\%, and a specificity of 100\%, which were all larger than single markers. Moreover, SAA1, FGA, and SAP were positively and CETP was negatively correlated with eosinophil count.
CONCLUSION: DIA-PRM combined analysis screened and validated four previously unexplored but potentially useful biomarkers for early diagnosis of EGPA and differential diagnosis of asthma.},

Spatially, CD4 T cells are preferentially depleted from the granuloma core and cuff relative to B cell-rich regions. Moreover, live imaging of granuloma explants show that intralesional CD4 T cell motility is reduced after SIV co-infection.

Granulomatous inflammation is the hallmark of MAC lung infection, yet reliable correlates of disease progression, susceptibility, and resolution are poorly defined. Unlike widely used inbred mouse strains, mice that carry the mutant allele at the genetic locus sst1 develop human-like pulmonary tuberculosis featuring well-organized caseating granulomas. We characterized pulmonary temporospatial outcomes of intranasal and left intrabronchial M. avium spp. hominissuis (M.av) induced pneumonia in B6.Sst1S mice, which carries the sst1 mutant allele. We utilized traditional semi-quantitative histomorphological evaluation, in combination with fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry (fmIHC), whole slide imaging, and quantitative digital image analysis. Followingintrabronchiolar infection with the laboratory M.av strain 101, the B6.Sst1S pulmonary lesions progressed 12-16 weeks post infection (wpi), with plateauing and/or resolving disease by 21 wpi. Caseating granulomas were not observed during the study. Disease progression from 12-16 wpi was associated with increased acid-fast bacilli, area of secondary granulomatous pneumonia lesions, and Arg1+ and double positive iNOS+/Arg1+ macrophages. Compared to B6 WT, at 16 wpi, B6.Sst1S lungs exhibited an increased area of acid-fast bacilli, larger secondary lesions with greater Arg1+ and double positive iNOS+/Arg1+ macrophages, and reduced T cell density. This morphomolecular analysis of histologic correlates of disease progression in B6.Sst1S could serve as a platform for assessment of medical countermeasures against NTM infection.},

Although it is widely accepted that local interactions between Mtb and the immune system in the tuberculous granuloma determine whether the outcome of infection is controlled or disseminated, these have been poorly studied due to methodological constraints. We have recently used a spatial transcriptomic technique, in situ sequencing (ISS), to define the spatial distribution of immune transcripts in TB mouse lungs. To further contribute to the understanding of the immune microenvironments of Mtb and their local diversity, we here present two complementary automated bacteria-guided analysis pipelines. These position 33 ISS-identified immune transcripts in relation to single bacteria and bacteria clusters. The analysis was applied on new ISS data from lung sections of Mtb-infected C57BL/6 and C3HeB/FeJ mice. In lungs from C57BL/6 mice early and late post infection, transcripts that define inflammatory macrophages were enriched at subcellular distances to bacteria, indicating the activation of infected macrophages. In contrast, expression patterns associated to antigen presentation were enriched in non-infected cells at 12 weeks post infection. T-cell transcripts were evenly distributed in the tissue. In Mtb-infected C3HeB/FeJ mice, transcripts characterizing activated macrophages localized in apposition to small bacteria clusters, but not in organized granulomas. Despite differences in the susceptibility to Mtb, the transcript patterns found around small bacteria clusters of C3HeB/FeJ and C57BL/6 mice were similar. Altogether, the presented tools allow us to characterize in depth the immune cell populations and their activation that interact with Mtb in the infected lung.},

Original granulomas differ in transcription-factor expression within adaptive lymphocytes, with those at 12 weeks showing higher frequencies of CD8+T-bet+ T cells, while CD4+T-bet+ T cells increase at 20 weeks post-infection. The appearance of T-bet+ adaptive T cells at 12 and 20 weeks is coincident with a reduction in bacterial burden, suggesting their critical role in Mtb control.

Tuberculosis is one of the top 10 causes of mortality worldwide, resulting in 1.8 million deaths and 10.4 million new cases in 2016. Understanding the fundamental features of MT biology is critical to the eradication of MT in the future. Due to the increasing frequency of antimicrobial treatment resistance and problems in vaccine development, the pathogenesis of TB for its survival and growth is highly dependent on host lipids and stimulated-lipid droplets formation. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) forms heterophilic dimers with TLR1 and TLR6, therefore, recognizing many MT components. Both of these receptors identify the invading antigen and activate downstream protein kinases. Some studies demonstrated that the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) promoter-driven gene expression includes connecting sites for transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B, CREB, NFAT, and c/EBPβ. The current study aimed to investigate the role of the TLR2 receptor in positively regulating prostaglandin E2 production in M. bovis (BCG) infected macrophages in vivo using a human monocytic cell line THP-1. Our results revealed that MT infection triggers a time-dependent increase in COX-2 expression via pathways involving TLR2 receptor activation and enhances COX-2 expression, leading to an increase in lipid droplet formation and suppression of macrophage activation.},

Using the zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum infection model, we demonstrate that vascular normalization by inhibition of vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (VE-PTP) decreases granuloma hypoxia, the opposite effect of hypoxia-inducing antiangiogenic therapy. Inhibition of VE-PTP decreased neutrophil recruitment to granulomas in adult and larval zebrafish, and decreased the proportion of neutrophils that extravasated distal to granulomas. Furthermore, VE-PTP inhibition increased the accumulation of T cells at M. marinum granulomas.

In individuals with latent TB infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells reside within granulomas in a nonreplicating dormant state, and a portion of them will develop active TB. Little is known on the bacterial mechanisms/factors involved in this process. In this study, we found that WhiB4, an oxygen sensor and a transcription factor, plays a critical role in disease progression and reactivation of Mycobacterium marinum (M. marinum) infection in zebrafish. We show that the whiB4::Tn mutant of M. marinum caused persistent infection in adult zebrafish, which is characterized by the lower but stable bacterial loads, constant number of nonnecrotized granulomas in fewer organs, and reduced inflammation compared to those of zebrafish infected with the wild-type bacteria or the complemented strain. The mutant bacteria in zebrafish were also less responsive to antibiotic treatments. Moreover, the whiB4::Tn mutant was defective in resuscitation from hypoxia-induced dormancy and the DosR regulon was dysregulated in the mutant. Taken together, our results suggest that WhiB4 is a major driver of reactivation from persistent infection. IMPORTANCE About one-quarter of the world's population has latent TB infection, and 5 to 10\% of those individuals will fall ill with TB. Our finding suggests that WhiB4 is an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutics, which may help to prevent the reactivation of latent infection, thereby reducing the incidences of active TB.},

Inflammatory monocytes contribute to the pathology of persistent salmonellosis and cluster with other cells in pathogen-containing granulomas. Depletion of inflammatory monocytes during the chronic phase of persistent salmonellosis causes regression of already established granulomas with resultant pathogen growth and spread in tissues. Thus, inflammatory monocytes promote granuloma-mediated control of persistent salmonellosis and may be key to uncovering new therapies for granulomatous diseases.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB), caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is one of the world's deadliest infectious diseases and remains a significant global health burden. TB disease and pathology can present clinically across a spectrum of outcomes, ranging from total sterilization of infection to active disease. Much remains unknown about the biology that drives an individual towards various clinical outcomes as it is challenging to experimentally address specific mechanisms driving clinical outcomes. Furthermore, it is unknown whether numbers of immune cells in the blood accurately reflect ongoing events during infection within human lungs. Herein, we utilize a systems biology approach by developing a whole-host model of the immune response to Mtb across multiple physiologic and time scales. This model, called HostSim, tracks events at the cellular, granuloma, organ, and host scale and represents the first whole-host, multi-scale model of the immune response following Mtb infection. We show that this model can capture various aspects of human and non-human primate TB disease and predict that biomarkers in the blood may only faithfully represent events in the lung at early time points after infection. We posit that HostSim, as a first step toward personalized digital twins in TB research, offers a powerful computational tool that can be used in concert with experimental approaches to understand and predict events about various aspects of TB disease and therapeutics.},

	abstract = {The normal operation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is critical for cells and organisms. However, ER stress, caused by imbalanced protein folding, occurs frequently, which perturbs the function of the ER and even results in cell apoptosis eventually. Many insults can induce ER stress; pathogen infection is one of them. Most of the genes involved in ER stress have been reported to be upregulated in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) granulomas of humans and mice, implicating that infection with Mtb can induce ER stress. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of Mtb induction of ER stress. Here, we reveal that Mycobacterium protein CDP-diglyceride hydrolase of Mycobacteriumn (CdhM) could target the ER and cause abnormal ER morphology and cell death. RNA-seq analysis suggests that most of the ER stress-involved genes were modulated by CdhM. Further assessed by biochemical experiments, the transcription and protein levels of ER stress markers BiP and CHOP, as well as the levels of XBP1 splicing and eIF2α phosphorylation, were significantly increased by CdhM, confirming that CdhM could induce ER stress alone or during infection. A single conserved amino acid mutant of CdhM, including L44A, G96A, H150A, and W175A, was incapable of inducing ER stress, which indicates that induction of ER stress by CdhM is specific and functional. Furthermore, CdhM-induced ER stress could also promote apoptosis of macrophages during Mtb infection. Overexpression of CdhM conferred a significant benefit for Mtb replication by releasing Mtb into extracellular during infection of macrophage in vitro, as presented in CFU assays. Overall, our study identified a novel Mtb effector protein CdhM which may promote Mtb dissemination and proliferation by induction of ER stress and apoptosis and provided new insight into the physiological significance of induction of ER stress in tuberculosis (TB) granulomas.},

DESIGN: The study included 20 POF and 20 PGCG cases diagnosed at the Pathology Department of Eskişehir Osmangazi University Medical Faculty. Hematoxylin \& Eosin-stained slides obtained from each biopsy specimen were re-evaluated, and IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-α antibodies were investigated immunohistochemically. While staining in stromal cells was examined in POF cases, staining in both stromal spindle cells and multinucleated giant cells was evaluated in PGCG cases. An immunoreactivity score was established for each case by evaluating the staining percentage and intensity for each individual case. The significance level was set at 5\% (p {\textless} 0.05).
RESULTS: The level of IL-6 and TNF-α expressions in the multinucleated giant cells in PGCG lesions was found higher than that in stromal cells (p {\textless} 0.005 and p {\textless} 0.000, respectively). In PGCG lesions, there was no significant difference between giant cells and stromal cells in terms of IL-1β and IL-17 expression levels. There was no significant difference between PGCG and POF lesions in terms of IL-1β and IL-6 expression. TNF-α expression levels were significantly higher in spindle cells of PGCG lesions than that of POF lesions (p {\textless} 0.00). However, IL-17 expression levels were significantly lower in PGCG lesions than in POF lesions (p {\textless} 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The study results showed that TNF-α expression was significantly higher in PGCG lesions and IL-17 expression in POF lesions. IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-α are involved in the pathogenesis of both PGCG and POF lesions.},

Studies were designed to examine recombinant human lactoferrin (rHLF) to modulate histological progression of Mtb-induced pathology in a non-necrotic model using C57Bl/6 mice. The rHLF was oral administered at times corresponding to initiation of primary granulomatous response, or during granuloma maintenance. Treatment with rHLF demonstrated significant reduction in size of primary inflammatory foci following Mtb challenge, and permitted penetration of ofloxacin fluoroquinolone therapeutic to sites of pathological disruption where activated (foamy) macrophages reside. Increased drug penetration was accompanied by retention of endothelial cell integrity. Immunohistochemistry revealed altered patterns of M1-like and M2-like phenotypic cell localization post infectious challenge, with increased presence of M2-like markers found evenly distributed throughout regions of pulmonary inflammatory foci in rHLF-treated mice.},

We constructed a comprehensive atlas that maps 19 cell subsets across 8 spatial microenvironments. This atlas shows an IFN-γ-depleted microenvironment enriched for TGF-β, regulatory T cells and IDO1+ PD-L1+ myeloid cells. In a further transcriptomic meta-analysis of peripheral blood from patients with TB, immunoregulatory trends mirror those identified by granuloma imaging. Notably, PD-L1 expression is associated with progression to active TB and treatment response.

In recent years, research on propolis has grown; however, there is little anthelmintic work on this bee product. In the propolis scenario, Brazilian ones receive attention, with green and red propolis standing out. This study aims to evaluate in vivo the standardized extract of Brazilian green propolis (Pex) against Schistosoma mansoni. The in vivo antiparasitic activity of Pex was conducted in female BALB/c mice infected with S. mansoni and of the three groups treated with Pex (300 mg/kg); G2 (35th to 42nd dpi) reduced the total worm burden by 55.32\%, followed by G3 (42nd to 49th dpi) and G4 (49th to 56th dpi), with about 46\%. Furthermore, G2 significantly reduced the total egg load in the ileum (59.33\%) and showed an increase in the dead eggs. Similarly, histological analysis of the livers showed a significant reduction in the number and diameter of the granulomas. Based on these results, there is an interesting schistosomicidal activity of Pex and its potential against the formation of hepatic granulomas, paving the way for more detailed studies of propolis in the animal model of schistosomiasis mansoni.},

This mechanism is now challenging because B lymphocytes also infiltrate injured tissue, and the deficiency in B lymphocytes is associated with limited lung granulomas in silica-treated mice. Here, we investigated how B lymphocytes respond to micro- and nanoparticles by combining in vivo and in vitro mouse models. We first demonstrated that innate-like B-1 lymphocytes (not conventional B-2 lymphocytes or plasma cells) specifically accumulated during granuloma formation in mice instilled with crystalline silica (DQ12, 2.5 mg/mouse) and carbon nanotubes (CNT Mitsui, 0.2 mg/mouse). In comparison to macrophages, peritoneal B-1 lymphocytes purified from naïve mice were resistant to the pyroptotic activity of reactive particles (up to 1 mg/mL) but clustered to establish in vitro cell/particle aggregates. Mouse B-1 lymphocytes (not B-2 lymphocytes) in coculture with macrophages and CNT (0.1 µg/mL) organized three-dimensional spheroid structures in Matrigel and stimulated the release of TIMP-1. Furthermore, purified B-1 lymphocytes are sensitive to nanosilica toxicity through radical generation in culture. Nanosilica-exposed B-1 lymphocytes released proinflammatory cytokines and alarmins. In conclusion, our data indicate that in addition to macrophages, B-1 lymphocytes participate in micrometric particle-induced granuloma formation and display inflammatory functions in response to nanoparticles.},

However, the early cellular interactions of the pulmonary granuloma are still not well understood. The use of this model allows investigation into the early interactions of cells within pulmonary granulomas which cannot be undertaken in human samples. Pulmonary granulomas from rhesus and cynomolgus macaques from two timepoints post infection were categorised into categories 1 - 6 (early to late stage granulomas) and immunohistochemistry was used to identify CD68+ macrophages, CD3+ T cells and CD20+ B cells. Multinucleated giant cells and acid-fast bacilli were also quantified. At week four post infection, cynomolgus macaques were found to have more CD68+ cells than rhesus in all but category 1 granulomas. Cynomolgus also had a significantly higher percentage of CD20+ B cells in category 1 granulomas. At week twelve post infection, CD68+ cells were most abundant in category 4 and 5 granulomas in both species; however, there were no significant differences between them. CD3+ T cells and CD20+ B cells were significantly higher in the majority of granuloma categories in cynomolgus compared to rhesus. Multinucleated giant cells and acid-fast bacilli were most abundant in categories 5 and 6 at week 12 post challenge in both species. This study has identified the basic cellular composition and spatial distribution of immune cells within pulmonary granulomas in both rhesus and cynomolgus macaques over time.

	abstract = {The severity of chronic schistosomiasis has been mainly associated with the intensity and extension of the inflammatory response induced by egg-secreted antigens in the host tissue, especially in the liver and intestine. During acute schistosomiasis, eosinophils account for approximately 50\% of the cells that compose the liver granulomas; however, the role of this cell-type in the pathology of schistosomiasis remains controversial. In the current study, we compared the parasite burden and liver immunopathological changes during experimental schistosomiasis in wild-type (WT) BALB/c mice and BALB/c mice selectively deficient for the differentiation of eosinophils (ΔdblGATA). Our data demonstrated that the absence of eosinophil differentiation did not alter the S. mansoni load or the liver retention of parasite eggs; however, there were significant changes in the liver immune response profile and tissue damage. S. mansoni infection in ΔdblGATA mice resulted in significantly lower liver concentrations of IL-5, IL-13, IL-33, IL-17, IL-10, and TGF-β and higher concentrations of IFN-γ and TNF-α, as compared to WT mice. The changes in liver immune response observed in infected ΔdblGATA mice were accompanied by lower collagen deposition, but higher liver damage and larger granulomas. Moreover, the absence of eosinophils resulted in a higher mortality rate in mice infected with a high parasite load. Therefore, the data indicated that eosinophils participate in the establishment and/or amplification of liver Th-2 and regulatory response induced by S. mansoni, which is necessary for the balance between liver damage and fibrosis, which in turn is essential for modulating disease severity.},

We show that mycobacterial infection limits DC mobility and also induces cellular cluster formation that has a similar composition to pulmonary mycobacterial granulomas. Within the clusters, infection from DCs disseminates to the recruited monocytes, promoting bacterial expansion. Mycobacterium-induced in vitro granulomas have been described previously, but this report shows that they can form on brain endothelial cell monolayers. Cellular cluster formation leads to cluster-associated damage of the endothelial cell monolayer defined by mitochondrial stress, disorganization of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and claudin-5, upregulation of the adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, and increased transmigration of bacteria-infected cells across the BBB. TNF-α inhibition reduces cluster formation on brain endothelial cells and mitigates cluster-associated damage. These data describe a model of bacterial dissemination across the BBB shedding light on a mechanism that might contribute to CNS tuberculosis infection and facilitate treatments.},

Granulomas are lesions that form in TB, and a PET probe for following neutrophil recruitment to granulomas could predict disease progression. We tested the formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1)-targeting peptide FLFLF in Mtb-infected macaques. Preliminary studies in mice demonstrated specificity for neutrophils. In macaques, 64Cu-FLFLF was retained in lung granulomas and analysis of lung granulomas identified positive correlations between 64Cu-FLFLF and neutrophil and macrophage numbers (R2 = 0.8681 and 0.7643, respectively), and weaker correlations for T cells and B cells (R2 = 0.5744 and 0.5908, respectively), suggesting that multiple cell types drive 64Cu-FLFLF avidity. By PET/CT imaging, we found that granulomas retained 64Cu-FLFLF but with less avidity than the glucose analog 18F-FDG. These studies suggest that neutrophil-specific probes have potential PET/CT applications in TB, but important issues need to be addressed before they can be used in nonhuman primates and humans.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Macrophages are pivotal cells in sarcoidosis. Monocytes-derived (MD) macrophages have recently been demonstrated to play a major role especially in pulmonary sarcoidosis. From inflammatory tissues to granulomas, they may be exposed to low oxygen tension environments. As hypoxia impact on sarcoidosis immune cells has never been addressed, we designed the present study to investigate MD-macrophages from sarcoidosis patients in this context. We hypothesized that hypoxia may induce functional changes on MD-macrophages which could have a potential impact on the course of sarcoidosis.
METHODS: We studied MD-macrophages, from high active sarcoidosis (AS) (n=26), low active or inactive sarcoidosis (IS) (n=24) and healthy controls (n=34) exposed 24 hours to normoxia (21\% O2) or hypoxia (1.5\% O2). Different macrophage functions were explored: hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation, cytokines secretion, phagocytosis, CD80/CD86/HLA-DR expression, profibrotic response.
RESULTS: We observed that hypoxia, with a significantly more pronounced effect in AS compared with controls and IS, increased the HIF-1α trans-activity, promoted a proinflammatory response (TNFα, IL1ß) without activating NF-κB pathway and a profibrotic response (TGFß1, PDGF-BB) with PAI-1 secretion associated with human lung fibroblast migration inhibition. These results were confirmed by immunodetection of HIF-1α and PAI-1 in granulomas observed in pulmonary biopsies from patients with sarcoidosis. Hypoxia also decreased the expression of CD80/CD86 and HLA-DR on MD-macrophages in the three groups while it did not impair phagocytosis and the expression of CD36 expression on cells in AS and IS at variance with controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia had a significant impact on MD-macrophages from sarcoidosis patients, with the strongest effect seen in patients with high active disease. Therefore, hypoxia could play a significant role in sarcoidosis pathogenesis by increasing the macrophage proinflammatory response, maintaining phagocytosis and reducing antigen presentation, leading to a deficient T cell response. In addition, hypoxia could favor fibrosis by promoting profibrotic cytokines response and by sequestering fibroblasts in the vicinity of granulomas.},

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has undergone prolonged coevolution with humans, and patients can control Mtb even after extensive infection, demonstrating the fine balance between protective and pathological host responses within infected granulomas. We hypothesized that whole transcriptome analysis of human TB granulomas isolated by laser capture microdissection could identify therapeutic targets, and that comparison with a noninfectious granulomatous disease, sarcoidosis, would identify disease-specific pathological mechanisms. Bioinformatic analysis of RNAseq data identified numerous shared pathways between TB and sarcoidosis lymph nodes, and also specific clusters demonstrating TB results from a dysregulated inflammatory immune response. To translate these insights, we compared 3 primary human cell culture models at the whole transcriptome level and demonstrated that the 3D collagen granuloma model most closely reflected human TB disease. We investigated shared signaling pathways with human disease and identified 12 intracellular enzymes as potential therapeutic targets. Sphingosine kinase 1 inhibition controlled Mtb growth, concurrently reducing intracellular pH in infected monocytes and suppressing inflammatory mediator secretion. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed that sphingosine kinase 1 is expressed in human lung TB granulomas, and therefore represents a host therapeutic target to improve TB outcomes.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is the most prevalent bacterial infectious disease in the world, caused by the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In this study, we have used Mycobacterium marinum (Mm) infection in zebrafish larvae as an animal model for this disease to study the role of the myeloid differentiation factor 88 (Myd88), the key adapter protein of Toll-like receptors. Previously, Myd88 has been shown to enhance innate immune responses against bacterial infections, and in the present study, we have investigated the effect of Myd88 deficiency on the granuloma morphology and the intracellular distribution of bacteria during Mm infection. Our results show that granulomas formed in the tail fin from myd88 mutant larvae have a more compact structure and contain a reduced number of leukocytes compared to the granulomas observed in wild-type larvae. These morphological differences were associated with an increased bacterial burden in the myd88 mutant. Electron microscopy analysis showed that the majority of Mm in the myd88 mutant are located extracellularly, whereas in the wild type, most bacteria were intracellular. In the myd88 mutant, intracellular bacteria were mainly present in compartments that were not electron-dense, suggesting that these compartments had not undergone fusion with a lysosome. In contrast, approximately half of the intracellular bacteria in wild-type larvae were found in electron-dense compartments. These observations in a zebrafish model for tuberculosis suggest a role for Myd88-dependent signalling in two important phenomena that limit mycobacterial growth in the infected tissue. It reduces the number of leukocytes at the site of infection and the acidification of bacteria-containing compartments inside these cells.},

However, the adverse side effects associated with agonist antibodies have hindered their clinical development. Here, we aimed to study the immune-related adverse events of repeated doses and long-term use of agonistic anti-4-1BB mAbs. We show that chronic activation of 4-1BB signals induced the accumulation of IFN-γ-producing PD-1+CD8+ T cells in the secondary lymphoid organs of tumor-bearing mice by increasing the number of dividing CD8+ T cells, which was beneficial for suppressing tumor growth in the early phase of anti-4-1BB induction. However, repeated exposure to anti-4-1BB mAbs led to granuloma development in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) of mice due to recruitment and accumulation of macrophages via the CD8+ T cell-IFN-γ axis. This was accompanied by excessive lymph node swelling, which impaired the sequential activation of CD8+ T cells. Our data provide insights into the immune-related adverse events of long-term agonist 4-1BB antibody dosing, which should be considered during the clinical development of immunomodulating therapy.},

People living with HIV are more susceptible to contracting Mycobacterium tuberculosis and often have worsened TB disease. Understanding the immunologic defects caused by HIV and the consequences it has on M. tuberculosis coinfection is critical in combating this global health epidemic. We previously showed in a model of SIV and M. tuberculosis coinfection in Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM) that SIV/M. tuberculosis-coinfected MCM had rapidly progressive TB. We hypothesized that pre-existing SIV infection impairs early T cell responses to M. tuberculosis infection. We infected MCM with SIVmac239, followed by coinfection with M. tuberculosis Erdman 6 mo later. Although similar, TB progression was observed in both SIV+ and SIV-naive animals at 6 wk post-M. tuberculosis infection; longitudinal sampling of the blood (PBMC) and airways (bronchoalveolar lavage) revealed a significant reduction in circulating CD4+ T cells and an influx of CD8+ T cells in airways of SIV+ animals. At sites of M. tuberculosis infection (i.e., granulomas), SIV/M. tuberculosis-coinfected animals had a higher proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1 and TIGIT. In addition, there were fewer TNF-producing CD4+ T cells in granulomas of SIV/M. tuberculosis-coinfected animals. Taken together, we show that concurrent SIV infection alters T cell phenotypes in granulomas during the early stages of TB disease. As it is critical to establish control of M. tuberculosis replication soon postinfection, these phenotypic changes may distinguish the immune dysfunction that arises from pre-existing SIV infection, which promotes TB progression.},

The innate immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is orchestrated by dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells and apparently mast cells (MCs). MCs are located at mucosal sites including the lungs and contribute in host-defence against pathogens, but little is known about their role during Mtb infection. This study investigates the location and characteristics of MCs in TB lesions to assess their contribution to TB pathology. To this purpose, number, location and phenotype of MCs was studied in 11 necropsies of pulmonary TB and 3 necropsies of non-TB infected lungs that were used as controls. MCs were localised at pneumonic areas, in the granuloma periphery and particularly abundant in fibrotic tissue. Furthermore, MCs displayed intracellular Mtb and IL-17A and TGF-β immunostaining. These findings were validated by analysing, post-mortem lung tissue microarrays from 44 individuals with pulmonary TB and 25 control subjects. In affected lungs, increased numbers of MCs expressing intracellularly both tryptase and chymase were found at fibrotic sites. Altogether, our data suggest that MCs are recruited at the inflammatory site and that actively produce immune mediators such as proteases and TGF-β that may be contributing to late fibrosis in TB lesions.},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Eighty four mice, divided into nine different groups, were sacrificed at 6th, 8th, and 10th week post-infection (PI), with assessment of parasitological, histopathological, and oxidative stress parameters, and scanning the worms by electron microscope. As a prophylactic drug, GNPs showed slight reduction in worm burden, egg density, and granuloma size and number. As a therapeutic drug, GNPs significantly reduced worm burden (59.9\%), tissue egg load (64.9\%), granuloma size, and number at 10th week PI, and altered adult worm tegumental architecture, added to antioxidant effect. Interestingly, combination of GNPs with PZQ or MFQ gave almost similar or sometimes better curative effects as obtained with each drug separately. The highest therapeutic effect was obtained when ½ dose GNPs combined with ½ dose MFQ which achieved 100\% reduction in both the total worm burden, and ova tissue density as early as the 6th week PI, with absence of detected eggs or tissue granuloma, and preservation of liver architecture.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: GNPs have a schistosomicidal, antioxidant, and hepatoprotective role. GNPs have a strong synergistic effect when combined with etiological treatments (PZQ or MFQ), and significantly reduced therapeutic doses by 50\%, which may mitigate side effects and resistance to etiological drugs, a hypothesis requiring further research.

This has been linked to worse clinical outcomes in tuberculosis, as undetected strains with different antibiotic resistance profiles can lead to treatment failure. Here, we examine the amount of polyclonal infections in sputum and surgical resections from patients with tuberculosis in the country of Georgia. For this purpose, we sequence and analyse the genomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from the samples, acquired through an observational clinical study (NCT02715271). Access to the lung enhanced the detection of multiple strains (40\% of surgery cases) as opposed to just using a sputum sample (0-5\% in the general population). We show that polyclonal infections often involve genetically distant strains and can be associated with reversion of the patient's drug susceptibility profile over time. In addition, we find different patterns of genetic diversity within lesions and across patients, including mutational signatures known to be associated with oxidative damage; this suggests that reactive oxygen species may be acting as a selective pressure in the granuloma environment. Our results support the idea that the magnitude of polyclonal infections in high-burden tuberculosis settings is underestimated when only testing sputum samples.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study airway pathophysiology and the role of dendritic cells (DCs) and IL-17 receptor (IL-17R) signals in a mouse model for CBD.
METHODS: Here, we present a CBD mouse model in which mice were exposed to beryllium during three weeks. We also exposed IL-17R-deficient mice and mice in which DCs were depleted.
RESULTS: Eight weeks after the initial beryllium exposure, an inflammatory response was detected in the lungs. Mice displayed inflammation of the lower airways that included focal dense infiltrates, granuloma-like foci, and tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) containing T cells, B cells, and germinal centers. Alveolar cell analysis showed significantly increased numbers of CD4+ T cells expressing IFNγ, IL-17, or both cytokines. The pathogenic role of IL-17R signals was demonstrated in IL-17R-deficient mice, which had strongly reduced lung inflammation and TLS development following beryllium exposure. In CBD mice, pulmonary DC subsets including CD103+ conventional DCs (cDCs), CD11b+ cDCs, and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) were also prominently increased. We used diphtheria toxin receptor-mediated targeted cell ablation to conditionally deplete DCs and found that DCs are essential for the maintenance of TLS in CBD. Furthermore, the presence of antinuclear autoantibodies in the serum of CBD mice showed that CBD had characteristics of autoimmune disease.
CONCLUSIONS: We generated a translational model of sarcoidosis driven by beryllium and show that DCs and IL-17R signals play a pathophysiological role in CBD development as well as in established CBD in vivo.},

	abstract = {Although doxycycline exhibits immunomodulatory properties, its effects on pulmonary infection by Schistosoma mansoni remain overlooked. Thus, we investigated the impact of this drug on lung granulomatous inflammation and microstructural remodeling in a murine model of schistosomiasis. Swiss mice were randomized in four groups: (i) uninfected, (ii) infected with S. mansoni and untreated, (iii) infected treated with praziquantel (Pzq; 200 mg/kg), and (iv) infected treated with Dox (50 mg/kg). Pz was administered in a single dose, and Dox for 60 days. S. mansoni induced marked granulomatous lung inflammation, which was associated to cytokines upregulation (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, and TGF-β), neutrophils and macrophages recruitment, alveolar collapse, lung fibrosis, and extensive depletion of elastic fibers. These parameters were attenuated by Pzq and aggravated by Dox. Exudative/productive granulomas were predominant in untreated and Dox-treated animals, while fibrotic granulomas were more frequent in Pzq-treated mice. The number and size of granulomas in Dox-treated animals was higher than untreated and Pzq-treated mice. Dox treatment inhibited the increase in MMP-1 and MMP-2 activity but upregulated myeloperoxidase and N-acetylglucosaminidase activity compared to untreated and Pzq-treated animals. Dox and Pzq exerted no effect on elastin depletion and upregulation of elastase activity. Together, our findings indicated that Dox aggravated granulomatous inflammation, accelerating lung microstructural remodeling by downregulating MMP-1 and MMP-2 activity without impair neutrophils and macrophages recruitment or elastase activity. Thus, Dox potentiates inflammatory damage associated with lung fibrosis, elastin depletion and massive alveolar collapse, profoundly subverting lung structure in S. mansoni-infected mice.},

	abstract = {Rationale: The etiology of sarcoidosis is unknown, but microbial agents are suspected as triggers.

Objectives: We sought to identify bacterial, fungal, or viral lineages in specimens from patients with sarcoidosis enriched relative to control subjects using metagenomic DNA sequencing. Because DNA from environmental contamination contributes disproportionately to samples with low authentic microbial content, we developed improved methods for filtering environmental contamination.

Methods: We analyzed specimens from subjects with sarcoidosis (n = 93), control subjects without sarcoidosis (n = 72), and various environmental controls (n = 150). Sarcoidosis specimens consisted of two independent sets of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph node biopsies, BAL, Kveim reagent, and fresh granulomatous spleen from a patient with sarcoidosis. All specimens were analyzed by bacterial 16S and fungal internal transcribed spacer ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. In addition, BAL was analyzed by shotgun sequencing of fractions enriched for viral particles, and Kveim and spleen were subjected to whole-genome shotgun sequencing.

Measurements and Main Results: In one tissue set, fungi in the Cladosporiaceae family were enriched in sarcoidosis compared with nonsarcoidosis tissues; in the other tissue set, we detected enrichment of several bacterial lineages in sarcoidosis but not Cladosporiaceae. BAL showed limited enrichment of Aspergillus fungi. Several microbial lineages were detected in Kveim and spleen, including Cladosporium. No microbial lineage was enriched in more than one sample type after correction for multiple comparisons.

Conclusions: Metagenomic sequencing revealed enrichment of microbes in single types of sarcoidosis samples but limited concordance across sample types. Statistical analysis accounting for environmental contamination was essential to avoiding false positives.},

	abstract = {Background Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease, the etiology of which is currently unknown. The role of mycobacteria in the etiology of sarcoidosis has been extensively investigated. In this meta-analysis, we assessed the immunological evidence of the possible role of mycobacteria in the pathogenesis and development of sarcoidosis. Methods We performed a systematic search of relevant articles from PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases published between January 1990 and October 2015. Data extracted from the articles were analyzed with Review Manager 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). Results In this meta-analysis, 13 case-control studies (733 participants) were considered eligible according to our criteria. Methodological quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The positivity incidence of the immune response (either the cell-mediated response or humoral response) in sarcoidosis patients was significantly higher than that in controls, as determined using fixed-effects model. The odds ratio (OR) of the positivity incidence of T-cell response in the patients with sarcoidosis versus the controls with PPD- or unknown PPD status was 5.54 (95\% CI 3.56–8.61); the ORs were 16.70 (95\% CI 8.19–34.08) and 1.48 (95\% CI 0.74–2.96) for the two subgroups with PPD- controls and unknown PPD status respectively. However, the OR of the positivity incidence in patients with sarcoidosis versus PPD+ controls (latent tuberculosis infection; LTBI) was 0.26 (95\% 0.10–0.66). Regarding the humoral response, pooled analysis of the positivity incidence revealed an OR (95\%CI) of 20.43 (5.53–75.53) for the patients with sarcoidosis versus controls; the ORs were 11.93 (95\% CI 2.15–66.27) and 41.97 (95\% CI 5.24–336.15) in two subgroups of controls with PPD- and unknown PPD statuses respectively. Data on heterogeneity and evidence of publication bias were examined. Conclusions This meta-analysis confirmed the existence of an association between mycobacteria (especially M.tuberculosis) and sarcoidosis. The current available evidence indicates that some insoluble mycobacterial antigens that preferentially within the body are involved in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis rather than the whole mycobacteria and that they elicit a type IV immune response.},

Furthermore, these lung diseases share certain clinical similarities that can challenge differential diagnosis in some cases. Here, through comparison of lung transcriptome-derived molecular signatures of TB, LUAD and sarcoidosis patients, we identify certain shared disease-related expression patterns. We also demonstrate that MKI67, an over-expressed gene shared by TB and LUAD, is a key mediator in Mtb-promoted tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Moreover, we reveal a distinct ossification-related TB lung signature, which may be associated with the activation of the BMP/SMAD/RUNX2 pathway in Mtb-infected macrophages that can restrain mycobacterial survival and promote osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Taken together, these findings provide novel pathogenic links and potential molecular markers for better understanding and differential diagnosis of pulmonary TB, LUAD and sarcoidosis.},

The study aims to identify sex-dependent genetic variations in two clinical sarcoidosis phenotypes: Löfgren’s syndrome (LS) and non-Löfgren’s syndrome (non-LS).MethodsA meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies was conducted on Europeans and African Americans, totaling 10,103 individuals from three population-based cohorts, Sweden (n = 3,843), Germany (n = 3,342), and the United States (n = 2,918), followed by an SNP lookup in the UK Biobank (UKB, n = 387,945). A genome-wide association study based on Immunochip data consisting of 141,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was conducted in the sex groups. The association test was based on logistic regression using the additive model in LS and non-LS sex groups independently. Additionally, gene-based analysis, gene expression, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping, and pathway analysis were performed to discover functionally relevant mechanisms related to sarcoidosis and biological sex.ResultsWe identified sex-dependent genetic variations in LS and non-LS sex groups. Genetic findings in LS sex groups were explicitly located in the extended Major Histocompatibility Complex (xMHC). In non-LS, genetic differences in the sex groups were primarily located in the MHC class II subregion and ANXA11. Gene-based analysis and eQTL enrichment revealed distinct sex-specific gene expression patterns in various tissues and immune cell types. In LS sex groups, a pathway map related to antigen presentation machinery by IFN-gamma. In non-LS, pathway maps related to immune response lectin-induced complement pathway in males and related to maturation and migration of dendritic cells in skin sensitization in females were identified.ConclusionOur findings provide new evidence for a sex bias underlying sarcoidosis genetic architecture, particularly in clinical phenotypes LS and non-LS. Biological sex likely plays a role in disease mechanisms in sarcoidosis.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown cause. Löfgren's syndrome (LS) is a characteristic subgroup of sarcoidosis that is associated with a good prognosis in sarcoidosis. However, little is known about its genetic architecture or its broader phenotype, non-LS sarcoidosis.
OBJECTIVES: To address the genetic architecture of sarcoidosis phenotypes, LS and non-LS.
METHODS: An association study in a white Swedish cohort of 384 LS, 664 non-LS, and 2,086 control subjects, totaling 3,134 subjects using a fine-mapping genotyping platform was conducted. Replication was performed in four independent cohorts, three of white European descent (Germany, n = 4,975; the Netherlands, n = 613; and Czech Republic, n = 521), and one of black African descent (United States, n = 1,657), totaling 7,766 subjects.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 727 LS-associated variants expanding throughout the extended major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region and 68 non-LS-associated variants located in the MHC class II region were identified and confirmed. A shared overlap between LS and non-LS defined by 17 variants located in the MHC class II region was found. Outside the MHC region, two LS-associated loci, in ADCY3 and between CSMD1 and MCPH1, were observed and replicated.
CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive and integrative analyses of genetics, transcription, and pathway modeling on LS and non-LS indicates that these sarcoidosis phenotypes have different genetic susceptibility, genomic distributions, and cellular activities, suggesting distinct molecular mechanisms in pathways related to immune response with a common region.},

We conducted a case control study to test a priori hypotheses that environmental and occupational exposures are associated with sarcoidosis. Ten centers recruited 706 newly diagnosed patients with sarcoidosis and an equal number of age-, race-, and sex-matched control subjects. Interviewers administered questionnaires containing questions regarding occupational and nonoccupational exposures that we assessed in univariable and multivariable analyses. We observed positive associations between sarcoidosis and specific occupations (e.g., agricultural employment, odds ratio [OR] 1.46, confidence interval [CI] 1.13–1.89), exposures (e.g., insecticides at work, OR 1.52, CI 1.14–2.04, and work environments with mold/mildew exposures [environments with possible exposures to microbial bioaerosols], OR 1.61, CI 1.13–2.31). A history of ever smoking cigarettes was less frequent among cases than control subjects (OR 0.62, CI 0.50–0.77). In multivariable modeling, we observed elevated ORs for work in areas with musty odors (OR 1.62, CI 1.24–2.11) and with occupational exposure to insecticides (OR 1.61, CI 1.13–2.28), and a decreased OR related to ever smoking cigarettes (OR 0.65, CI 0.51–0.82). The study did not identify a single, predominant cause of sarcoidosis. We identified several exposures associated with sarcoidosis risk, including insecticides, agricultural employment, and microbial bioaerosols.},

	abstract = {The aetiology of sarcoidosis is currently unknown. Due to the clinical and histological similarities between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, the role of mycobacteria has been repeatedly investigated as an aetiological agent for sarcoidosis. The current meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the available molecular evidence on the possible role of mycobacteria in the development of sarcoidosis.
The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, DARE and CENTRAL databases were searched for relevant studies published from 1980 to 2006, and studies evaluating the presence of mycobacteria using molecular techniques in biological samples of patients with sarcoidosis were included in the current analysis. The 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the expected proportion (of individual studies); the data was then pooled to obtain a summary success rate with 95\% CI. The odds ratio (95\% CI) was also calculated in order to assess the presence of mycobacteria in samples of patients with sarcoidosis versus those from nonsarcoidosis control samples.
The database search yielded 31 studies. All studies used polymerase chain reaction for nucleic acid amplification followed by identification of nucleic acid sequences specific for different types of mycobacteria. Overall, 231 out of the 874 patients were positive for mycobacteria with a positive signal rate of 26.4 (23.6–29.5\%), and the odds of finding mycobacteria in samples of patients with sarcoidosis versus controls were 9.67 (4.56–20.5\%) using the random effects model and 19.49 (11.21–35.54\%) using the exact method. There was methodological and statistical heterogeneity and evidence of publication bias.
The results of the current study illustrate a demonstrable mycobacterial presence in sarcoidosis lesions suggesting an association between mycobacteria and some cases of sarcoidosis. To avoid methodological diversity, larger multicentre trials with a central laboratory for sample testing should be designed.},

	abstract = {Background Molecular methods based on phylogenetic differences in the 16S rRNA gene are able to characterise the microbiota of the respiratory tract in health and disease.
Objectives Our goals were (1) to characterise bacterial communities in lower and upper airways of patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and (2) to compare the results with the microbiota of patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and normal controls.
Methods We examined the upper and lower respiratory tract of 18 patients with ILD of whom 5, 6, and 7 had idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), non-IIP and sarcoidosis, respectively. In addition, six immune-compromised patients with PCP and nine healthy subjects were included as controls. Exclusion criteria were recent bacterial/viral respiratory tract infection, HIV-positivity and subjects receiving antibiotic therapy. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and oropharyngeal swabs were simultaneously collected, and microbiota was characterised by ultra-deep 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
Results The microbiota in lower airways of the majority of patients (30; 90\%) primarily consisted of Prevotellaceae, Streptococcaceae and Acidaminococcaceae. α and β diversity measurements revealed no significant differences in airway microbiota composition between the five different groups of patients. Comparison of bacterial populations in upper and lower respiratory tract showed significant topographical discontinuities for 7 (23\%) individuals.
Conclusions IIP, non-IIP and sarcoidosis are not associated with disordered airway microbiota and a pathogenic role of commensals in the disease process is therefore unlikely. Nevertheless, molecular analysis of the topographical microbiota continuity along the respiratory tract may provide additional information to assist management of individual patients.},

Here, through chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of primary human CD4+ T cells, we show that regions within the STAT3 locus are significantly enriched for binding by the transcription factor estrogen receptor alpha (ERa). Using the murine model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, we found significantly increased regulatory T cells compared to Th17 cells in the female lung. The genetic absence of ESR1 or ovariectomy in mice significantly increased pSTAT3 and IL-17A expression in pulmonary CD4+ T cells, which was reduced after the repletion of female hormones. Remarkably, there was no significant reduction in lung fibrosis under either condition, suggesting that factors outside of ovarian hormones also contribute. An assessment of lung fibrosis among menstruating females in different rearing environments revealed that environments favoring gut dysbiosis augment fibrosis. Furthermore, hormone repletion following ovariectomy further augmented lung fibrosis, suggesting pathologic interactions between gonadal hormones and gut microbiota in relation to lung fibrosis severity. An analysis of female sarcoidosis patients revealed a significant reduction in pSTAT3 and IL-17A levels and a concomitant increase in TGF-β1 levels in CD4+ T cells compared to male sarcoidosis patients. These studies reveal that estrogen is profibrotic in females and that gut dysbiosis in menstruating females augments lung fibrosis severity, supporting a critical interaction between gonadal hormones and gut flora in lung fibrosis pathogenesis.},

It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

	abstract = {Background The analysis of microbial communities through DNA sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. Results Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing is now regularly used for studies of the transcriptome (RNA-seq), particularly for comparisons among experimental conditions. For the time being, a limited number of biological replicates are typically considered in such experiments, leading to low detection power for differential expression. As their cost continues to decrease, it is likely that additional follow-up studies will be conducted to re-address the same biological question.
RESULTS: We demonstrate how p-value combination techniques previously used for microarray meta-analyses can be used for the differential analysis of RNA-seq data from multiple related studies. These techniques are compared to a negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM) including a fixed study effect on simulated data and real data on human melanoma cell lines. The GLM with fixed study effect performed well for low inter-study variation and small numbers of studies, but was outperformed by the meta-analysis methods for moderate to large inter-study variability and larger numbers of studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The p-value combination techniques illustrated here are a valuable tool to perform differential meta-analyses of RNA-seq data by appropriately accounting for biological and technical variability within studies as well as additional study-specific effects. An R package metaRNASeq is available on the CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metaRNASeq).},

	abstract = {Despite reports of familial clustering of sarcoidosis, little empirical evidence exists that disease risk in family members of sarcoidosis cases is greater than that in the general population. To address this question, we estimated sarcoidosis familial relative risk using data on disease occurrence in 10,862 first- and 17,047 second-degree relatives of 706 age, sex, race, and geographically matched cases and controls who participated in the multicenter ACCESS (A Case-Control Etiology Study of Sarcoidosis) study from 1996 to 1999. Familial relative risk estimates were calculated using a logistic regression technique that accounted for the dependence between relatives. Sibs had the highest relative risk (odds ratio [OR] = 5.8; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1-15.9), followed by avuncular relationships (OR = 5.7; 95\% CI = 1.6-20.7), grandparents (OR = 5.2; 95\% CI = 1.5-18.0), and then parents (OR = 3.8; 95\% CI = 1.2-11.3). In a multivariate model fit to the parents and sibs data, the familial relative risk adjusted for age, sex, relative class, and shared environment was 4.7 (95\% CI = 2.3-9.7). White cases had a markedly higher familial relative risk compared with African-American cases (18.0 versus 2.8; p = 0.098). In summary, a significant elevated risk of sarcoidosis was observed among first- and second-degree relatives of sarcoidosis cases compared with relatives of matched control subjects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although numerous reports have described the clinical features of sarcoidosis in various ethnic and racial groups, many have been limited by small size, homogenous populations, and relatively short follow-up periods. We report the clinical characteristics of a large, race-sex-age diverse cohort of sarcoidosis clinic patients followed in a large university medical center for an extended period of time.
METHODS: This study included clinical data for sarcoidosis patients followed over a 12-year period at a sarcoidosis clinic at the Medical University of South Carolina.
RESULTS: 1774 sarcoidosis patients were identified. Black females were more common (44\%) than other race/gender combinations (p = 0.01). The diagnosis of sarcoidosis occurred {\textgreater} 3 months after the onset of symptoms in 48\% of the cohort and {\textgreater} 1 year after the onset of symptoms in 25\%. Anti-sarcoidosis treatment was required in 61\% of the patients. Pulmonary function improved over time and the median corticosteroid requirement lessened. Compared to whites, blacks had more advanced radiographic stages of sarcoidosis (p {\textless} 0.0001), more organ involvement (p {\textless} 0.0001), and more frequently required anti-sarcoidosis medication (p {\textless} 0.0001). Compared to women, men had more advanced radiographic stages of sarcoidosis (p {\textless} 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: The analysis indicates that sarcoidosis tends to improve over time in terms of pulmonary function and medication requirements. The disease was found to be more severe in blacks than whites. Treatment was not necessarily required. These results provide a comprehensive model of the course and treatment of sarcoidosis in the clinical setting.},

Data on the natural history of hepatic sarcoid and response to therapy are lacking. This study investigates hepatic dysfunction complicating lung disease and significant liver involvement presenting independent of pulmonary sarcoid.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty patients were included in the study. The minimum follow-up was 2 years.
RESULTS: Fifty per cent of the study population had derangement of liver function attributable to hepatic sarcoid. Twenty-three patients (13\%) had liver involvement without lung disease. Sixty-three patients were administered corticosteroids; approximately one-third had a complete clinical response, one-third a partial response and one-third showed no response. Fourteen patients (8\%) were cirrhotic at presentation, and two progressed to cirrhosis despite steroid therapy. Sixteen patients received a second-line immunosuppressive agent; one-half of these showed a response to treatment augmentation (four patients azathioprine, three patients methotrexate, one patient both drugs). Six patients required liver transplantation, with disease recurrence in one recipient. In four patients, sarcoid as the aetiology of end-stage liver disease was diagnosed only on examination of the explanted liver.
CONCLUSION: Sarcoidosis can cause end-stage chronic liver disease, which is often unrecognized until examination of the explanted liver. Response to conventional immunosuppression is variable and unpredictable. Transplantation is feasible and safe in this population but recurrence is possible.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2R) has been proposed as a marker of disease activity in patients with sarcoidosis. However, no studies have evaluated whether serum sIL-2R measurement is of use in establishing the diagnosis of sarcoidosis in patients who are suspected of sarcoidosis among other diseases.
METHODS: A cohort study was conducted, consisting of new patients who visited the immunology outpatient clinic and whose serum sIL-2R levels were available before a definitive diagnosis was established between February 2011 and February 2016. All patients underwent standard diagnostic testing for sarcoidosis (e.g. laboratory tests, radiographic and/or nuclear imaging and/or affected site biopsy). This resulted either in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis or the exclusion of sarcoidosis with the diagnosis of another disease. Results of sIL-2R and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, radiographic and nuclear imaging and histology results were collected and definitive diagnoses were recorded. Sensitivity, specificity, the concordance statistic from the receiver operating characteristic curve and Youden's Index were calculated to assess the performance of sIL-2R in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and were compared to ACE, currently one of the most used diagnostic biomarkers in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
RESULTS: In total 983 patients were screened for inclusion, of which 189 patients met the inclusion criteria. A total of 101 patients were diagnosed with sarcoidosis after diagnostic workup, of whom 79 were biopsy-proven. In 88 patients a diagnosis other than sarcoidosis was made. The sensitivity and specificity of serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels to detect sarcoidosis were 88\% and 85\%. The sensitivity and specificity of ACE were 62\% and 76\%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that sIL-2R receptor is superior to ACE (p{\textless}0.0001).
CONCLUSION: Serum sIL-2R is a sensitive biomarker and superior to ACE in establishing the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and can be used to rule out sarcoidosis in patients suspected of sarcoidosis.},

Here we found that PtpA suppressed innate immunity dependent on pathways of the kinases Jnk and p38 and the transcription factor NF-κB by exploiting host ubiquitin. Binding of PtpA to ubiquitin via a region with no homology to human proteins activated it to dephosphorylate phosphorylated Jnk and p38, leading to suppression of innate immunity. Furthermore, the host adaptor TAB3 mediated NF-κB signaling by sensing ubiquitin chains, and PtpA blocked this process by competitively binding the ubiquitin-interacting domain of TAB3. Our findings reveal how pathogens subvert innate immunity by coopting host ubiquitin and suggest a potential tuberculosis treatment via targeting of ubiquitin-PtpA interfaces.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare interstitial lung disease with a poor prognosis that currently lacks effective treatment methods. Preventing the acute exacerbation of IPF, identifying the molecular subtypes of patients, providing personalized treatment, and developing individualized drugs are guidelines for predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM / 3PM) to promote the development of IPF. Oxidative stress (OS) is an important pathological process of IPF. However, the relationship between the expression levels of oxidative stress-related genes (OSRGs) and clinical indices in patients with IPF is unclear; therefore, it is still a challenge to identify potential beneficiaries of antioxidant therapy. Because PPPM aims to recognize and manage diseases by integrating multiple methods, patient stratification and analysis based on OSRGs and identifying biomarkers can help achieve the above goals.
METHODS: Transcriptome data from 250 IPF patients were divided into training and validation sets. Core OSRGs were identified in the training set and subsequently clustered to identify oxidative stress-related subtypes. The oxidative stress scores, clinical characteristics, and expression levels of senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs) of different subtypes were compared to identify patients who were sensitive to antioxidant therapy to conduct differential gene functional enrichment analysis and predict potential therapeutic drugs. Diagnostic markers between subtypes were obtained by integrating multiple machine learning methods, their expression levels were tested in rat models with different degrees of pulmonary fibrosis and validation sets, and nomogram models were constructed. CIBERSORT, single-cell RNA sequencing, and immunofluorescence staining were used to explore the effects of OSRGs on the immune microenvironment.
RESULTS: Core OSRGs classified IPF into two subtypes. Patients classified into subtypes with low oxidative stress levels had better clinical scores, less severe fibrosis, and lower expression of SASP-related molecules. A reliable nomogram model based on five diagnostic markers was constructed, and these markers' expression stability was verified in animal experiments. The number of neutrophils in the immune microenvironment was significantly different between the two subtypes and was closely related to the degree of fibrosis.
CONCLUSION: Within the framework of PPPM, this work comprehensively explored the role of OSRGs and their mediated cellular senescence and immune processes in the progress of IPF and assessed their capabilities aspredictors of high oxidative stress and disease progression,targets of the vicious loop between regulated pulmonary fibrosis and OS for targeted secondary and tertiary prevention, andreferences for personalized antioxidant and antifibrotic therapies.

	abstract = {Lung fibrosis is a progressive fatal disease in which deregulated wound healing of lung epithelial cells drives progressive fibrotic changes. Persistent lung injury due to oxidative stress and chronic inflammation are central features of lung fibrosis. Chronic cigarette smoking causes oxidative stress and is a major risk factor for lung fibrosis. The objective of this manuscript is to develop an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) that serves as a framework for investigation of the mechanisms of lung fibrosis due to lung injury caused by inhaled toxicants, including cigarette smoke. Based on the weight of evidence, oxidative stress is proposed as a molecular initiating event (MIE) which leads to increased secretion of proinflammatory and profibrotic mediators (key event 1 (KE1)). At the cellular level, these proinflammatory signals induce the recruitment of inflammatory cells (KE2), which in turn, increase fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation (KE3). At the tissue level, an increase in extracellular matrix deposition (KE4) subsequently culminates in lung fibrosis, the adverse outcome. We have also defined a new KE relationship between the MIE and KE3. This AOP provides a mechanistic platform to understand and evaluate how persistent oxidative stress from lung injury may develop into lung fibrosis.},

	abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) presents as an incurable change in the lung tissue and mitochondrial dysfunction of unknown origin. Treprostinil, a prostacyclin analogue, has been suggested for IPF therapy. This study assessed the effect of treprostinil on the cAMP signalling and mitochondrial activity in healthy lung fibroblasts and fibroblast-like cells from IPF patients. Six control fibroblast strains and six fibroblast-like IPF cell strains were isolated and expanded from freshly resected lung tissue. The cells were grown to confluence before being treated with either transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, treprostinil, their combination, or a vehicle for up to 2 days. Mitochondria-regulating proteins were analysed using Western blotting and immunofluorescence, and the mitochondria were analysed using cytochrome C, mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase II (MTCO2), and MTCO4. The IPF cells showed an increased rate of damaged mitochondria, which were significantly reduced when the cells were treated with treprostinil over 24 h. In the control cells, treprostinil prevented TGF-β-induced mitochondrial damage. Treatment with treprostinil modified the expression of several mitochondria-regulating proteins. In both cell types, treprostinil upregulated the expression of PTEN, p21(Waf1/Cip1), beclin1, LC3 II, parkin, PINK1, MTCO2, and MTCO4. In contrast, treprostinil downregulated the phosphorylation of mTOR and the expression of p62, mitofusin1, and mtiofusin2 in IPF cells. This might explain the reduced mitochondrial damage observed in treprostinil-treated IPF cells and suggest an improvement in the mitochondrial function in IPF. In this study, treprostinil improved mitochondrial impairment in vitro, which might, in part, explain the beneficial clinical effects documented in patients.},

For this, 28 Swiss mice were used, divided into two groups (G1 and G2), with 14 animals each. Of these, eight were infected with ten infective larvae each, by gavage, and six were used as a control group. Mice from G1 and G2 were euthanized at 14 days and 24 days post-infection, respectively. Tissue samples were used for histopathological analysis and blood (serum) samples were taken to assess the levels of proteins, non-protein thiols (NPTs) and nitric oxide (NO), from centrifugation and subsequent collection of aliquots of the supernatant. Among OS parameters, infected mice in both groups had higher NO levels than the control group, due to the presence of: eosinophil infiltrate in the liver and intestine; pancreatitis; and intestinal granuloma. However, the infected mice of both groups showed a reduction in the levels of NPTs, in relation to the control group, due to the presence of: eosinophilic infiltrate in the liver and intestine; and intestinal granuloma. Our results suggest that A. costaricensis infection has important effects on the intestine, liver and pancreas, and the analyses were performed from the tissue of these organs. The mechanisms for these changes are related to the decrease in the body's main antioxidant defences, as demonstrated by the reduction of NPTs, thus contributing to the development of more severe tissue damage. Thus, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between histopathological lesions and markers for OS.},

	abstract = {Objective
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is the major cause of death in cardiac sarcoidosis (CS). We aimed to identify the prognostic markers for sustained ventricular tachycardia (sVT) and SCD in patients with CS.

Methods
We performed a prospective observational cohort study for patients with CS diagnosed according to the Japanese or Heart Rhythm Society guidelines between June 2008 and March 2020 in our hospital. The primary endpoint was a composite of the first sVT and SCD. The levels of urinary 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (U-8-OHdG), a marker of oxidative DNA damage that reflects the inflammatory activity of CS, other biomarkers, and indices of cardiac function and renal function were measured on admission.

Results
Eighty-nine consecutive patients with CS were enrolled; 28 patients with no abnormal 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) accumulation in the heart were excluded and 61 patients with abnormal 18F-FDG accumulation were followed up for a median of 46 months (IQR: 20–84). During the follow-up period, 15 of 61 patients showed sVT (n=12) or SCD (n=3). A Cox proportional hazard model showed that U-8-OHdG concentration and presence of ventricular aneurysm (VA) were independent predictors of first sVT/SCD. The cut-off U-8-OHdG concentration for predicting first sVT/SCD was 14.9 ng/mg·Cr. Patients with U-8-OHdG concentration ≥14.9 ng/mg·Cr and VA showed a significantly increased risk of sVT/SCD.

Conclusions
U-8-OHdG and presence of VA were powerful predictors of first sVT/SCD in patients with CS, facilitating the stratification of cardiac events and providing relevant information about the substrates of ventricular tachycardia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigated the relationship between inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and arginase pathways, cytokines, macrophages, oxidative damage and lung granulomatous inflammation in S. mansoni-infected and doxycycline-treated mice.
METHODS: Swiss mice were randomized in four groups: (i) uninfected, (ii) infected with S. mansoni, (iii) infected + 200 mg/kg praziquantel (Pzt), (iv) and (v) infected + 5 and 50 mg/kg doxycycline. Pzt (reference drug) was administered in a single dose and doxycycline for 60 days.
RESULTS: S. mansoni-infection determined extensive lung inflammation, marked recruitment of M2 macrophages, cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IFN-γ, TNF-α) upregulation, intense eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) levels, arginase expression and activity, reduced iNOS expression and nitric oxide (NO) production. The higher dose of doxycycline aggravated lung granulomatous inflammation, downregulating IL-4 levels and M2 macrophages recruitment, and upregulating iNOS expression, EPO, NO, IFN-γ, TNF-α, M1 macrophages, protein carbonyl and malondialdehyde tissue levels. The number and size of granulomas in doxycycline-treated animals was higher than untreated and Pzt-treated mice. Exudative/productive granulomas were predominant in untreated and doxycycline-treated animals, while fibrotic/involutive granulomas were more frequent in Pzt-treated mice. The reference treatment with Pzt attenuated all these parameters.
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that doxycycline aggravated lung granulomatous inflammation in a dose-dependent way. Although Th1 effectors are protective against several intracellular pathogens, effective schistosomicidal responses are dependent of the Th2 phenotype. Thus, doxycycline contributes to the worsening of lung granulomatous inflammation by potentiating eosinophils influx and downregulating Th2 effectors, reinforcing lipid and protein oxidative damage in chronic S. mansoni infection.},

Among them, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) is the most common cause of pulmonary NTM disease worldwide., Nrf2 is a redox-sensitive transcription factor that is thought to be important in protection against intracellular pathogens. To determine the protective role of Nrf2 in the host defense against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), both wild-type and Nrf2-deficient mice were intranasally infected with MAC bacteria. Nrf2-deficient mice were highly susceptible to MAC bacteria compared with wild-type mice. There were no significant changes in the levels of oxidative stress and Th1 cytokine production between genotypes. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis showed that the expressions of Nramp1 and HO-1 were much lower in the infected lungs, and the expression of Nramp1 was especially lower in alveolar macrophages of Nrf2-deficient mice than of wild-type mice. Electron microscopy showed that many infected alveolar macrophages from Nrf2-deficient mice contained a large number of intracellular MAC bacteria with little formation of phagolysosomes, compared with those from wild-type mice. Treatment with sulforaphane, an activator of Nrf2, increased resistance to MAC with increased lung expression of Nramp1 and HO-1 in wild-type mice. These results indicate that Nramp1 and HO-1, regulated by Nrf2, are essential in defending against MAC infection due to the promotion of phagolysosome fusion and granuloma formation, respectively. Thus, Nrf2 is thought to be a critical determinant of host resistance to MAC infection.},

We examined catalase expression in cultured P. acnes isolated from 19 sarcoid and 18 control lymph nodes and immunohistochemical localization of the protein in lymph nodes from 43 sarcoidosis and 102 control patients using a novel P. acnes-specific antibody (PAC) that reacts with the catalase protein, together with the previously reported P. acnes-specific PAB and TIG antibodies. High catalase expression of P. acnes cells was found during stationary phase in more isolates from sarcoid than from non-sarcoid lymph nodes and was associated with bacterial survival under H2O2-induced oxidative stress. In many sarcoid and some control lymph nodes, catalase expression was detected at the outer margins of PAB-reactive Hamazaki-Wesenberg (HW) bodies in sinus macrophages, the same location as catalase expression on the surface of cultured P. acnes and the same distribution as bacterial cell membrane-bound lipoteichoic acid in HW bodies. Some or no catalase expression was detected in sarcoid granulomas with PAB reactivity or in clustered paracortical macrophages packed with many PAB-reactive small-round bodies. HW bodies expressing catalase may be persistent P. acnes in sinus macrophages whereas PAB-reactive small-round bodies with undetectable catalase may be activated P. acnes proliferating in paracortical macrophages.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disease of unknown aetiology with a variable clinical course and prognosis. There is a growing need to identify non-invasive biomarkers to differentiate between clinical phenotypes, identify those at risk of disease progression and monitor response to treatment.
OBJECTIVES: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the utility of breath-based biomarkers in discriminating sarcoidosis from healthy controls, alongside correlation with existing non breath-based biomarkers used in clinical practice, radiological stage, markers of disease activity and response to treatment.
METHODS: Electronic searches were undertaken during November 2017 using PubMed, Ebsco, Embase and Web of Science to capture relevant studies evaluating breath-based biomarkers in adult patients with sarcoidosis.
RESULTS: 353 papers were screened; 21 met the inclusion criteria and assessed 25 different biomarkers alongside VOCs in exhaled breath gas or condensate. Considerable heterogeneity existed amongst the studies in terms of participant characteristics, sampling and analytical methods. Elevated biomarkers in sarcoidosis included 8-isoprostane, carbon monoxide, neopterin, TGF-β1, TNFα, CysLT and several metallic elements including chromium, silicon and nickel. Three studies exploring VOCs were able to distinguish sarcoidosis from controls. Meta-analysis of four studies assessing alveolar nitric oxide showed no significant difference between sarcoidosis and healthy controls (2.22 ppb; 95\% CI -0.83, 5.27) however, a high degree of heterogeneity was observed with an I 2 of 93.4\% (p {\textless} 0.001). Inconsistent or statistically insignificant results were observed for correlations between several biomarkers and radiological stage, markers of disease activity or treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: The evidence for using breath biomarkers to diagnose and monitor sarcoidosis remains inconclusive with many studies limited by small sample sizes and lack of standardisation. VOCs have shown promising potential but further research is required to evaluate their prognostic role.},

	abstract = {CD4+ T-cell mediated Th1 immune responses are critical for immunity to TB. The immunomodulatory protein, lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) decreases Th1-type immune responses in T-cells. LAG-3 expression is significantly induced in the lungs of macaques with active TB and correlates with increased bacterial burden. Overproduction of LAG-3 can greatly diminish responses and could lead to uncontrolled Mtb replication. To assess the effect of LAG-3 on the progression of Mtb infection, we developed a co-culture system wherein blood-derived macrophages are infected with Mtb and supplemented with macaque blood or lung derived CD4+ T-cells. Silencing LAG-3 signaling in macaque lung CD4+ T-cells enhanced killing of Mtb in co-cultures, accompanied by reduced mitochondrial electron transport and increased IFN-γ expression. Thus, LAG-3 may modulate adaptive immunity to Mtb infection by interfering with the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Better understanding this pathway could allow us to circumvent immune features that promote disease.},

	abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has complex and dynamic interactions with the human host, and subpopulations of Mtb that emerge during infection can influence disease outcomes. This study implicates zinc ion (Zn2+) availability as a likely driver of bacterial phenotypic heterogeneity in vivo. Zn2+ sequestration is part of "nutritional immunity", where the immune system limits micronutrients to control pathogen growth, but this defense mechanism seems to be ineffective in controlling Mtb infection. Nonetheless, Zn2+-limitation is an environmental cue sensed by Mtb, as calprotectin triggers the zinc uptake regulator (Zur) regulon response in vitro and co-localizes with Zn2+-limited Mtb in vivo. Prolonged Zn2+ limitation leads to numerous physiological changes in vitro, including differential expression of certain antigens, alterations in lipid metabolism and distinct cell surface morphology. Furthermore, Mtb enduring limited Zn2+ employ defensive measures to fight oxidative stress, by increasing expression of proteins involved in DNA repair and antioxidant activity, including well described virulence factors KatG and AhpC, along with altered utilization of redox cofactors. Here, we propose a model in which prolonged Zn2+ limitation defines a population of Mtb with anticipatory adaptations against impending immune attack, based on the evidence that Zn2+-limited Mtb are more resistant to oxidative stress and exhibit increased survival and induce more severe pulmonary granulomas in mice. Considering that extracellular Mtb may transit through the Zn2+-limited caseum before infecting naïve immune cells or upon host-to-host transmission, the resulting phenotypic heterogeneity driven by varied Zn2+ availability likely plays a key role during early interactions with host cells.},

A current therapeutic strategy attempting to circumvent this issue aims to enhance drug delivery to reduce the duration of the antibiotic regimen or dosage of first-line antibiotics. One such agent that may help is cyclic peptide [R4W4], as it has been shown to have antibacterial properties (in combination with tetracycline) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the past. The objective of this study is to test cyclic peptide [R4W4] both alone and in combination with current first-line antibiotics (either isoniazid or pyrazinamide) to study the effects of inhibition of M. tb inside in vitro human granulomas.

METHODS: Six patients with AMA myopathy were identified and their muscle MRI findings evaluated.
RESULTS: On thigh muscle MRI, all six patients showed high signal intensity with short-tau inversion recovery that reflected disease activity mostly in the adductor magnus, called a "cuneiform sign." Fatty degeneration was also prominent in the adductor magnus, as well as the semimembranosus muscles.
DISCUSSION: These characteristic changes on MRI contrast with those of other inflammatory myopathies. From these observations, we concluded that the localization pattern of the inflammatory changes in muscle MRI can contribute to the diagnosis of AMA myopathy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, we reported that urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (U-8-OHdG), an oxidative stress marker, reflected inflammatory activity in cardiac sarcoidosis (CS). Here, we investigated whether U-8-OHdG levels were associated with ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients with CS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective cohort study enrolled 62 consecutive patients with CS, of whom 36 were diagnosed as having active CS based on abnormal 18F-flurodeoxyglucose accumulation in the heart on positron-emission tomography/computed tomography. The 36 patients with active CS were subdivided as having CS with sustained VT (CS-VT group; n=18) or CS without sustained VT (CS-nVT group; n=18). Twenty-seven patients diagnosed with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy served as heart failure controls. U-8-OHdG, brain natriuretic peptide, cardiac function indices, and immunohistological data from subendomyocardial biopsy samples were compared across groups. Immunohistochemical examination of ventricle biopsy samples revealed that the anti-8-OHdG antibody-positive area of cardiac tissue was significantly greater in CS-VT than in CS-nVT or dilated cardiomyopathy and significantly correlated with U-8-OHdG levels (n=58; R=0.61; P{\textless}0.00001), which were significantly higher in CS-VT than in CS-nVT (24.6±7.1 versus 15.2±3.8 ng/mg·Cr; P{\textless}0.0001). Other baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups. Multivariate analysis indicated that U-8-OHdG was an independent determinant factor for VT. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to identify patients with VT resulted in a U-8-OHdG cutoff value of 17.5 ng/mg·Cr (sensitivity, 89\%; specificity, 83\%; area under the curve, 0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: U-8-OHdG levels are associated with VT in patients with active CS diagnosed by 18F-flurodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography, providing additive and relevant information about the arrhythmia substrate.},

	abstract = {Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. Recent studies demonstrated that its pathogenesis is related with enhanced oxidative stress (protein carbonylation and lipid peroxidation) and alterations in the circulating lipid profile. Alterations of lipid metabolism (including the reduction in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and apolipoprotein A1 concentrations) induce plasma membrane, bronchial and lung capillary endothelial cell damage in sarcoidosis patients. Dyslipidemia is associated with increased oxidative stress, diminished overall antioxidative protection and increased risk for atherosclerosis. Very recently increased cardiovascular biomarkers (in particular alterations of lipoprotein A and d-dimer concentrations) were observed in sarcoidosis patients, mainly in those with a high risk of atherosclerosis. Chitotriosidase, a biomarker of sarcoidosis activity and macrophage activation, is increased in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with sarcoidosis as well as in patients with atherosclerosis. Lipidomics and other recent methodologies allowed the discovery of proteins involved in lipid metabolism and sarcoidosis pathogenesis, such as serum amyloid A, a biomarker of sarcoidosis activity, involved in innate immune response, inflammation and apolipoprotein metabolism. In this review lipid metabolism alteration and atherosclerosis risk in sarcoidosis patients were discussed in order to contribute to this novel and interesting research topic.},

Thirty rats were divided into two groups: the group A (uninfected, n = 18) and the group B (infected by S. schenckii, n=21). Blood samples were collected on days 15, 30 and 40 post-infection (PI). At each sampling time, six rats of the group A, and seven of the group B were bled. TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) levels in serum samples were measured to evaluate lipid peroxidation. In addition, catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, known as biomarkers of antioxidants levels, were verified in whole blood. Seric pro-inflammatory cytokine levels were measured (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-6), which showed that these inflammatory mediators were at higher levels in the infected rats (P {\textless} 0.001). In comparison to uninfected animals, rats with sporotrichosis showed significantly higher (p {\textless} 0.01) levels of TBARS on day 40 PI; CAT activity was significantly increased (p {\textless} 0.01) on days 30 and 40 PI; and SOD activity was increased (p {\textless} 0.01) on day 40 PI. Infected rats showed larger testicles and granulomas in the testicular capsule, as well as hepatic granulomas and splenic follicular hyperplasia. All tissues (testicle, spleen, and liver) showed inflammation associated with numerous fungal structures. These results demonstrated that the intense inflammatory response (seric and tissue) in sporotrichosis is a likely mechanism for redox imbalance, and consequently cause the oxidative stress in experimentally infected rats.},

Cotton pellet induced granuloma model in rats was used to assess the anti-inflammatory potential of the aqueous extract of Turbinaria ornata (ATO) (30, 100 and 300mg/kg, p.o) which was compared with dexamethasone (0.1mg/kg, p.o) a standard anti-inflammatory agent. Granuloma weight, haematological parameters and plasma markers (LDH, GPT, and CRP) were estimated. Further, the levels of oxidative stress markers (SOD, GPx, GSH, LPO, and Nitrite) and inflammatory markers (Cathepsin D and MPO) in the hepatic tissue were measured. ATO decreased the granuloma weight dose dependently. ATO significantly reversed the levels of biochemical and inflammatory markers in comparison to the vehicle treated rats. The active constituent, fucoidan (sulphated polysaccharide) from the aqueous extract was fractionated and characterized using GCMS. The sulphated polysaccharide (TSP) from ATO confirms the presence of sulphates and sugars. The present findings suggest ATO to be a potent inhibitor of both proliferative and exudative phases of inflammation possibly mediated by the sulphated polysaccharides which might inhibit the action of COX-2 enzyme analogous to dexamethasone.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been reported that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant roles thanks to different enzymes such as paraoxonase 1 (PON1). Under inflammatory and oxidative stress conditions, HDL particles may lose their protective properties. Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by excessive oxidative stress. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is produced in liver and in granulomas, and its concentration increases in inflammatory conditions contributing to increased catabolism of HDL particles. The aim of our study was to determine PON1 activity, SAA concentration and their associations in patients with sarcoidosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Inflammatory [high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), SAA], lipid [total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), triglycerides (TG)] oxidative stress status parameters [total oxidant status (TOS), malondialdehyde (MDA), pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB), sulfhydryl (SH) groups] and PON1 activities were determined in serum of 72 patients with sarcoidosis and 62 healthy subjects.
RESULTS: HsCRP (P {\textless} 0·05), TC, LDL-c, TG, SAA, TOS, MDA and PAB (P {\textless} 0·001) were significantly higher, whereas HDL-c, SH groups and PON1 activity (P {\textless} 0·001) were significantly lower in patients with sarcoidosis when compared with controls. PON1 showed significant association with SAA, MDA and PAB. It was shown that 71\% of decrease in PON1 activity may be explained by increase in TOS, PAB and SAA concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: We found decreased PON1 activity and increased SAA concentration in patients with sarcoidosis. Inflammatory condition presented by high SAA was implicated in impaired HDL functionality evident through dysregulated PON1 activity. Excessive oxidative stress was also involved in dysregulation of PON1 activity.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.rmed.2016.01.011},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress (OS) has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis and previous studies have shown that anti-oxidants can reduce markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in the peripheral blood of sarcoidosis subjects. We investigated the effect of N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) on oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in the lungs of sarcoidosis patients.
METHODS: We randomized 11 sarcoidosis subjects to active therapy and 3 to placebo for 8 weeks in a double blinded study. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage was performed pre and post therapy. Our primary endpoint was TNF-α production from stimulated and unstimulated BAL cells. Secondary outcomes included measures of oxidative stress (GSH, 8-OHdG) levels in the BAL. In-vitro studies were also performed to assess the effect of NAC on lipopolysaccharide stimulated BAL cell production of TNF-α.
RESULTS: Eight subjects in the active group and 2 in the placebo group completed the study protocol. Eight weeks of oral NAC did not have a significant impact on TNF-α levels from BAL cells in-vivo in spite of a 59\% increase in BAL GSH levels. Our in vitro studies showed a significant decline in TNF-α production from LPS stimulated BAL cells treated with 5 and 10 mM of NAC.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral NAC increased GSH levels but failed to suppress in-vivo TNF-α production in contrast to effects in-vitro. Anti-oxidant therapy may still play a role in the management of sarcoidosis but therapy with better bioavailability or potency is needed to suppress the lung inflammatory response.},

Despite knowing of its existence for centuries, much remains unclear regarding the host and bacterial factors that contribute to granuloma formation, heterogeneity of presentation, and the forces at play within. Mtb is highly adapted to life within the granuloma and employs many unique strategies to both create a niche within the host as well as survive the stresses imposed upon it. Adding to the complexity of the granuloma is the vast range of pathology observed, often within the same individual. Here, we explore some of the many ways in which Mtb crafts the immune response to its liking and builds a variety of granuloma features that contribute to its survival. We also consider the multitude of ways that Mtb is adapted to life in the granuloma and how variability in the deployment of these strategies may result in different fates for both the bacterium and the host. It is through better understanding of these complex interactions that we may begin to strategize novel approaches for tuberculosis treatments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ethnopharmacological practitioners in Nigeria have used aqueous and ethanol extracts of Bridelia micrantha leaves to manage conditions associated with inflammation, and these include diabetes, chest pain, edema, arthritis and joint pains. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of methanol leaf extract of B. micrantha on chronic inflammation and oxidative stress which accompany diabetic conditions, in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Albino Wistar rats.
METHODS: The dried leaves were extracted by percolation in 80\% methanol:water for 72 h after which the mixture was filtered using Whatman No. 1 (11 μm) filter papers. Acute toxicity studies were done using Wistar rats and given orally up to a dose of 2,000 mg/kg. The animals were monitored for 48 h. The experimental design involved five (5) groups of six (6) albino Wistar diabetic rats each. Groups A, B and C rats received 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg B. micrantha respectively while groups D (negative control) and E (positive control) rats received 10 mL/kg normal saline and 200 mg/kg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) respectively by gastric gavage for 7 days. Two sterilized cotton pellets (10 mg each) were implanted subcutaneously into both sides of the dorsal area of each diabetic rat in all the groups. Post cotton pellet implantation, rats in three groups (A, B and C) were treated with 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg B. micrantha extract, while those in two groups (D and E) were treated with acetyl salicylic acid (ASA 200 mg/kg) and normal saline (10 mL/kg) respectively by gastric gavage for 7 days. Serum obtained from the animals on Day 8 of the cotton pellet test were used for malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) assays.
RESULTS: The administration of the leaf extract up to a dose of 2,000 mg/kg to rats produced absolutely no death or observable signs of toxicity in 48 h. The cotton pellet granuloma weights in 200 mg/kg (44.88±1.2 mg), 400 mg/kg (42.10±1.2 mg) B. micrantha extract treated groups and ASA at 200 mg/kg (43.25±1.8 mg) were significantly lower compared to weight of granuloma (85.50±3.2 mg) obtained in the group treated with normal saline. Serum malondialdehyde (MDA) level in the 200 mg/kg (3.32±0.72 nmol/mL) and 400 mg/kg (1.88±1.27 nmol/mL) B. micrantha extract treated groups were significantly (p{\textless}0.05) lower compared to MDA level (6.88±0.79 nmol/mL) in the serum of normal saline treated group. Treatment of diabetic rats with the B. micrantha extract also caused significant (p{\textless}0.05) elevation in serum catalase, SOD and GSH levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that B. micrantha methanol leaf extract significantly inhibited some chronic inflammation and oxidative stress parameters in diabetes mellitus.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The application of nanoparticles is widely spread in all aspects of modern life because of their unique features such as small size and high surface area. High surface area can be very reactive and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). These nanoparticles can damage human and animal cells by increasing oxidative stress mechanism. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) are among the top five nanoparticles used in consumer products, paints, and pharmaceutical preparations.TiO2 NPs have various capabilities such as robust oxidation, biocompatibility and photocatalytic properties. They are frequently used in a wide range of sciences, including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, medicine and engineering. The ever increasing industrial and consumer applications of TiO2NPs raise concern over the possible risk association with their environmental exposure.
METHODS: This study investigates the effects of TiO2NP on lung tissue by intraperitoneal injection to rats at different doses (15, 30, 60 and 70 mg/kg).
RESULTS: Our results showed that intraperitoneal injection of TiO2NP creates capillary congestion and hemorrhage in alveolar wall, granulomas in lung parenchyma, and hemosiderin depositions in blood vessels adjacent to bronchioles without any inflammation. The pulmonary side effects could be due to the production of ROS post TiO2NP exposure (Tab. 1, Fig. 5, Ref. 27). Text in PDF www.elis.sk.},

The aim of this study was directed to evaluate the curative effect of propolis (Pps) alone or in combination with PZQ on biochemical, immunological, parasitological, and histological changes associated with experimental schistosomiasis in mice. Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice were divided into two experimental sets, each with four subgroups: (i) untreated, (ii) treated with Pps/day p.o for 4 weeks, (iii) treated with PZQ p.o 2 × 500 mg/kg bd wt, and (iv) treated with Pps + PZQ as in group ii and iii; all treatments started on the 8th week postinfection, in addition to uninfected group as control for the previous groups. Treatment of infected mice with Pps, although failed to eradicate the worm, significantly reduced the hepatic granuloma number, their lymphocytic infiltration and aggregation, hepatic and splenic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and plasma, and liver and thymus nitric oxide (NOx) levels together with normalization of plasma proteins and alleviation of oxidative stress in the examined tissues as evidenced by reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) and normalization of glutathione (GSH). Promising results were obtained when Pps was given in combination with PZQ, where the anti-schistosomal activity of PZQ was markedly potentiated with complete alleviation and amelioration of the histological and biochemical alteration associated with schistosomiasis. This study highlights the potential usefulness of Pps as an adjunct to PZQ in schistosomiasis.},

	abstract = {Treatment-induced epididymal inflammation and granuloma formation is only an occasional problem in preclinical drug development, but it can effectively terminate the development of that candidate molecule. Screening for backup molecules without that toxicity must be performed in animals (generally rats) that requires at least 2 to 3 weeks of in vivo exposure, a great deal of specially synthesized candidate compound, and histologic examination of the target tissues. We instead hypothesized that these treatments induced proinflammatory gene expression, and so used mixed-cell cultures from the rat epididymal tubule to monitor the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Cells were exposed for 24 hr and then cytotoxicity was evaluated with the MTS assay and mRNA levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and growth-related oncogene (GRO) were measured. We found that compounds that were more toxic in vivo stimulated a greater induction of IL-6 and GRO mRNA levels in vitro. By relating effective concentrations in vitro with the predicted C(eff), we could rank compounds by their propensity to induce inflammation in rats in vivo. This method allowed the identification of several compounds with very low inflammatory induction in vitro. When tested in rats, the compounds produced small degrees of inflammation at an acceptable margin (approximately 20×), and have progressed into further development.},

Therefore, our study was conducted to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin either alone or in combination with aspirin. Air pouch granuloma model was used for induction of inflammation in 72 male Wistar albino rats, which were treated with simvastatin (20 mg/kg/day), aspirin (25 mg/kg/day) or both for 3 or 6 executive days. Inflammatory exudates were collected and measured. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring exudates' malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO). Inflammatory mediator C-reactive protein (CRP) was investigated using slide agglutination test. Exudates' levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-4 were measured by ELISA. We found that simvastatin alone or in combination with aspirin exerts anti-inflammatory effects by reducing volume of exudates. Simvastatin significantly reduced serum level of CRP and exudates levels of TNF-α, IL-6 and MDA as well as significantly elevated exudates level of NO and IL-4. The results of simvastain were comparable to those of aspirin. In conclusion, air pouch granuloma interrupted the balance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers, which is restored by simvastatin. The anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin are comparable to aspirin and their combination may produce better effects especially in the attenuation of the oxidative stress and IL-6.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little is known about the role of free-radical and oxidative stress signaling in granuloma maturation and resolution. We aimed to study the activity of free-radical oxidation processes in the dynamics of BCG-induced generalized granulomatosis in mice.
METHODS: Chronic granulomatous inflammation was induced in male BALB/c mice by intravenously injecting the BCG vaccine, and the production of oxidative stress (activity of free-radical oxidation processes) and histological changes in the lungs, liver, and peritoneal exudate were measured 3, 30, 60, and 90 days after infection.
RESULTS: The tuberculous granuloma numerical density and diameter continuously increased from day 30 to day 90, and the macrophage content within the granulomas progressively diminished with a concomitant elevation in the number of epithelioid cells. The activity of the free-radical oxidation processes in the liver (i.e., the intensity of the homogenate chemiluminescence) reached a maximum at postinfection day 60 and subsequently began to decrease. The peak generation of reactive oxygen species by phagocytes in the peritoneal exudate (measured using flow cytometry) was also shifted in time and fell on day 30.
CONCLUSIONS: The rise in the steady-state concentration of H2O2 in the liver of mice with BCG-induced granulomatosis is not related to local H2O2 production by phagocytes, and a decrease in the severity of generalized inflammation precedes the resolution of local inflammation.},

We aimed to explore differences in 8-isoprostane levels in IPF and sarcoidosis patients, and controls.
METHODS: We included 16 IPF and 55 sarcoidosis patients, as well as 17 controls in the study. 8-Isoprostane levels were measured in serum and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).
RESULTS: Serum 8-isoprostane levels were increased in all patient groups vs controls (p{\textless}0.001). The systemic 8-isoprostane concentrations were higher in sarcoidosis patients as compared to IPF subjects and controls (p=0.017 and p{\textless}0.001, respectively). IPF patients exhibited increased serum 8-isoprostane levels when compared to controls (p{\textless}0.001). Sarcoidosis patients presented significantly increased 8-isoprostane BAL levels when compared to IPF patients (p=0.002).
CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the level of oxidative stress, as reflected by 8-isoprostane concentrations, is enhanced in patients with sarcoidosis, and to a lesser extent, in IPF patients when compared to controls, suggesting a potential implication of redox imbalance in both diseases.},

The cytoprotective action of the inducible HO-1 isoform, encoded by the Hmox1 gene, is required for host protection against systemic infections. Here we report that upregulation of HO-1 expression in macrophages (M) is strictly required for protection against mycobacterial infection in mice. HO-1-deficient (Hmox1(-/-)) mice are more susceptible to intravenous Mycobacterium avium infection, failing to mount a protective granulomatous response and developing higher pathogen loads, than infected wild-type (Hmox1(+/+)) controls. Furthermore, Hmox1(-/-) mice also develop higher pathogen loads and ultimately succumb when challenged with a low-dose aerosol infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The protective effect of HO-1 acts independently of adaptive immunity, as revealed in M. avium-infected Hmox1(-/-) versus Hmox1(+/+) SCID mice lacking mature B and T cells. In the absence of HO-1, heme accumulation acts as a cytotoxic pro-oxidant in infected M, an effect mimicked by exogenous heme administration to M. avium-infected wild-type M in vitro or to mice in vivo. In conclusion, HO-1 prevents the cytotoxic effect of heme in M, contributing critically to host resistance to Mycobacterium infection.},

	abstract = {Pathogens are detected by innate immune receptors that, upon activation, orchestrate an appropriate immune response. Recent studies revealed the intracellular signaling cascades involved in the TLR-initiated immune response to Brucella abortus infection. However, no report has elucidated the role of inflammasome receptors in Brucella recognition. Therefore, we decided to investigate the function of NLRC4, NLRP3, and AIM2 in sensing Brucella. In this study, we showed that NLRC4 is not required to induce caspase-1 activation and further secretion of IL-1β by B. abortus in macrophages. In contrast, we determined that AIM2, which senses Brucella DNA, and NLRP3 are partially required for caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion. Additionally, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species induced by Brucella were implicated in IL-1β production. Furthermore, AIM2, NLRP3, ASC, and caspase-1 knockout mice were more susceptible to B. abortus infection than were wild-type animals, suggesting that multiple ASC-dependent inflammasomes contribute to host protection against infection. This protective effect is due to the inflammatory response caused by IL-1β and IL-18 rather than pyroptosis, because we observed augmented bacterial burden in IL-1R and IL-18 knockout mice. Finally, we determined that bacterial type IV secretion system VirB and live, but not heat-killed, Brucella are required for full inflammasome activation in macrophages during infection. Taken together, our results indicate that Brucella is sensed by ASC inflammasomes that collectively orchestrate a robust caspase-1 activation and proinflammatory response.},

Here, we investigated whether Pairogen affects host immune function in a murine model of granulomatous inflammation in response to Rhodococcus aurantiacus (R. aurantiacus) infection. Longitudinal ingestion of Pairogen markedly improved the survival of infected mice in a concentration-dependent manner. Compared to mice received water, mice that ingested 10-fold-diluted Pairogen displayed rapid bacterial elimination, decreased production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6, and high levels of IL-10 in organs during the initial phase of infection. Moreover, histological studies showed significant reduction in the number and size of granulomas as well as amelioration of oxidative stress in the livers of mice ingested 10-fold-diluted Pairogen at 14 d post-infection. These characteristics were further pronounced in first-generation (F1) mice that also ingested 10-fold-diluted Pairogen. Following stimulation with heat-killed R. aurantiacus, the production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 by macrophages from F1 mice was similar to that detected in vivo, while their gene expression levels in these cells were significantly lower than the levels in macrophages from mice received water. Heat-killed R. aurantiacus also induced the expression of heme oxygenase-1 mRNA in the cells from F1 mice. Taken together, these results indicate that Pairogen contributes to the negative regulation of the immuno-inflammatory response to R. aurantiacus infection in mice by modulating the cellular redox state. Longitudinal ingestion of Pairogen further enhances the defense function in mouse progeny.},

	abstract = {Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a progressive cholestatic liver disease characterized by the immune-mediated destruction of biliary epithelial cells in small intrahepatic bile ducts. The disease is characterized by circulating antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) as well as disease-specific antinuclear antibodies, cholestatic liver function tests, and characteristic histological features, including granulomas. A variety of organisms are involved in granuloma formation, of which mycobacteria are the most commonly associated. This has led to the hypothesis that mycobacteria may be involved in the pathogenesis of PBC, along with other infectious agents. Additionally, AMAs are found in a subgroup of patients with mycobacterial infections, such as leprosy and pulmonary tuberculosis. Antibodies against species-specific mycobacterial proteins have been reported in patients with PBC, but it is not clear whether these antibodies are specific for the disease. In addition, data in support of the involvement of the role of molecular mimicry between mycobacterial and human mitochondrial antigens as triggers of cross-reactive immune responses leading to the loss of immunological tolerance, and the induction of pathological features have been published. Thus, antibodies against mycobacterial heat shock protein appear to cross-recognize AMA-specific autoantigens, but it is not clear whether these autoantibodies are mycobacterium-species-specific, and whether they are pathogenic or incidental. The view that mycobacteria are infectious triggers of PBC is intriguing, but the data provided so far are not conclusive.},

However, despite a longstanding recognition of neutrophil presence at disease sites in tuberculosis, their role in defense against mycobacteria is unclear. Here we exploit the genetic tractability and optical transparency of zebrafish to monitor neutrophil behavior and its consequences during infection with Mycobacterium marinum, a natural fish pathogen. In contrast to macrophages, neutrophils do not interact with mycobacteria at initial infection sites. Neutrophils are subsequently recruited to the nascent granuloma in response to signals from dying infected macrophages within the granuloma, which they phagocytose. Some neutrophils then rapidly kill the internalized mycobacteria through NADPH oxidase-dependent mechanisms. Our results provide a mechanistic link to the observed patterns of neutrophils in human tuberculous granulomas and the susceptibility of humans with chronic granulomatous disease to mycobacterial infection.},

LTs play a role in the control of helminth and protozoan infections by modulating the immune system and/or through direct cytotoxicity to parasites; however, LTs may also be associated with pathogenesis, such as in cerebral malaria and schistosomal granuloma. Interestingly, some proteins from the saliva of insect vectors that transmit protozoans and secreted protein from helminth could bind LTs and may consequently modulate the course of infection or pathogenesis. In addition, the decreased production of LTs in immunocompromised individuals might modulate the pathophysiology of helminth and protozoan infections. Herein, in this paper, we showed the immunomodulatory and pathogenic roles of LTs during the helminth and protozoan infections.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease characterised by enhanced production of reactive oxygen species and alterations in the circulating lipid profile. Both attributes are thought to play a role in its pathogenesis. However, current knowledge regarding the significance of blood oxidative stress/anti-oxidant defence as well as alterations in lipid status parameters in sarcoidosis is scarce. The aim of our study was to assess these parameters and their inter-relationships, as well as their potential for patient-control discrimination.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Oxidative stress status and anti-oxidant defence parameters were determined in serum and erythrocytes and lipid status parameters were assessed in the serum of 213 treated sarcoidosis patients and 90 controls.
RESULTS: Malondialdehyde, superoxide anion, total oxidant status, prooxidant-antioxidant balance and triglycerides were significantly higher whereas total anti-oxidant status, superoxide dismutase activity and HDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in sarcoidosis patients compared with controls. Total sulfhydryl group content was higher in patients compared with controls. Serum and erythrocyte malondialdehyde exhibited the strongest ability to predict disease presence. Elevated oxidative stress was characterised by higher clinical accuracy compared with lipid status abnormality. Some oxidative stress and lipid status markers were significantly associated in sarcoidosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Sarcoidosis is characterised by increased oxidative stress, diminished overall anti-oxidative protection and alterations in the circulating lipid profile. Both oxidative stress and lipid status parameters demonstrated the potential to discriminate sarcoidosis from controls which was particularly evident from the point of view of oxidative stress status parameters. Association between these parameters may indicate an increased risk for atherosclerosis development.},

However, the biological effects of nanoceria exposure have yet to be fully defined, which gave us the impetus to examine its systemic biodistribution and biological responses. An extensively characterized nanoceria (5 nm) dispersion was vascularly infused into rats, which were terminated 1 h, 20 h or 30 days later. Light and electron microscopic tissue characterization was conducted and hepatic oxidative stress parameters determined. We observed acute ceria nanoparticle sequestration by Kupffer cells with subsequent bioretention in parenchymal cells as well. The internalized ceria nanoparticles appeared as spherical agglomerates of varying dimension without specific organelle penetration. In hepatocytes, the agglomerated nanoceria frequently localized to the plasma membrane facing bile canaliculi. Hepatic stellate cells also sequestered nanoceria. Within the sinusoids, sustained nanoceria bioretention was associated with granuloma formations comprised of Kupffer cells and intermingling CD3⁺ T cells. A statistically significant elevation of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level was seen at 1 and 20 h, but subsided by 30 days after ceria administration. Further, elevated apoptosis was observed on day 30. These findings, together with increased hepatic protein carbonyl levels on day 30, indicate ceria-induced hepatic injury and oxidative stress, respectively. Such observations suggest a single vascular infusion of nanoceria can lead to persistent hepatic retention of particles with possible implications for occupational and therapeutic exposures.},

Nine organs were weighed and samples collected from 14 tissues/organs/systems, blood and cerebrospinal fluid for cerium determination. Histology and oxidative stress were assessed. Less than 1\% of the nanoceria was excreted in the first 2 weeks, 98\% in feces. Body weight gain was initially impaired. Spleen weight was significantly increased in some ceria-treated groups, associated with abnormalities. Ceria was primarily retained in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. There was little decrease of ceria in any tissue over the 90 days. Granulomas were observed in the liver. Time-dependent oxidative stress changes were seen in the liver and spleen. Nanoscale ceria was persistently retained by organs of the mononuclear phagocyte system, associated with adverse changes. The results support concern about the long-term fate and adverse effects of inert nanoscale metal oxides that distribute throughout the body, are persistently retained, and produce adverse changes.},

Xanthohumol (XN), a beer-derived polyphenol, inhibits these processes in many physiopathological situations. This study aimed at examining whether XN ingestion affects wound healing. Wistar rats drinking water, 5\% ethanol, stout beer (SB) or stout beer supplemented with 10 mg/L XN (Suppl SB) for 4 weeks, were subjected to a 1.5 cm full skin-thickness longitudinal incision, and further maintained under the same beverage conditions for another week. No differences in beverage consumption or body weight were found throughout the study but food intake decreased in every group relative to controls. Consumption of Suppl SB resulted in decreased serum VEGF levels (18.42\%), N-acetylglucosaminidase activity (27.77\%), IL1β concentration (9.07\%), and NO released (77.06\%), accompanied by a reduced redox state as observed by increased GSH/GSSG ratio (to 198.80\%). Also, the number of blood vessels within the wound granulation tissue seems to reduce in animals drinking Suppl SB (23.08\%). Interestingly, SB and primarily Suppl SB showed a tendency to increase adipocyte number (to 194.26\% and 156.68\%, respectively) and reduce adipocyte size (4.60\% and 24.64\%, respectively) within the granuloma. Liver function and metabolism did not change among the animal groups as analyzed by plasma biochemical parameters, indicating no beverage toxicity. This study shows that XN intake in its natural beer context reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis, ameliorating the wound healing process, suggesting that this polyphenol may exert beneficial effect as a nutritional supplement.},

We used a novel approach, applying high resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (HRMAS NMR) directly to infected tissues, allowing us to study the development of tuberculosis granulomas in guinea pigs in an untargeted manner. Significant up-regulation of lactate, alanine, acetate, glutamate, oxidized and the reduced form of glutathione, aspartate, creatine, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, betaine, trimethylamine N-oxide, myo-inositol, scyllo-inositol, and dihydroxyacetone was clearly visualized and was identified as the infection progressed. Concomitantly, phosphatidylcholine was down-regulated. Principal component analysis of NMR data revealed clear group separation between infected and uninfected tissues. These metabolites are suggestive of utilization of alternate energy sources by the infiltrating cells that generate much of the metabolites in the increasingly necrotic and hypoxic developing granuloma through the glycolytic, pentose phosphate, and tricarboxylic acid pathways. The most relevant changes seen are, surprisingly, very similar to metabolic changes seen in cancer during tumor development.},

We examined tissues of the bronchus and lung obtained from 16 patients with sarcoidosis consisting of 2 stage 0, 10 stage I and 4 stage II patients, and 11 controls. The morphology of capillary endothelial cells was studied using electron microscopy. In the samples from patients with sarcoidosis, lipid droplets exhibiting dark monophasic density (unsaturated fatty acids) were surrounded by abundant lysosomes in the capillary endothelial cells, and the double-membrane structure of the mitochondria attached to these lipid droplets was lost in three cases. Biphasic lipid droplets with dark and lucent (saturated fatty acids) densities were also observed, accompanied by a few lysosomes containing the residual bodies of undigested lipid-containing substances. Lucent monophasic droplets were also detected in the tissues from patients with sarcoidosis. The plasma membrane was more often damaged in capillary endothelial cells containing biphasic lipid droplets, lucent monophasic droplets as well as in those with dark monophasic droplets. However, no lipid droplets were detected in capillary endothelial cells obtained from the control subjects, except in a single case. This study demonstrated that a large number of mitochondria were mobilized and showed notable morphological changes including swelling in the capillary endothelial cells in patients with sarcoidosis. A close relationship between mitochondria and lipid droplets was observed in capillary endothelial cells of the respiratory tract, and this relation may be involved in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Oxidative stress and low antioxidant levels are implicated in the aetiology of sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease. Quercetin is a potent dietary antioxidant that also displays anti-inflammatory activities. Consequently, the aim is to examine the effect of quercetin supplementation on markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in sarcoidosis.
METHODS: A double-blind intervention study has been conducted with two groups of non-smoking, un-treated sarcoidosis patients, matched for age and gender. One group was given 4x500 mg quercetin (n = 12) orally within 24 h, the other one placebo (n = 6). Plasma malondialdehyde levels were used as marker of oxidative damage, plasma ratios of TNFα/IL-10 and IL-8/IL-10 as pro-inflammatory markers.
RESULTS: Quercetin supplementation improved the antioxidant defence, indicated by the increased total plasma antioxidant capacity. Moreover, quercetin supplementation also reduced markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in the blood of sarcoidosis patients. The effects of quercetin supplementation appeared to be more pronounced when the levels of the oxidative stress and inflammation markers were higher at baseline.
CONCLUSIONS: Sarcoidosis patients might benefit from the use of antioxidants, such as quercetin, to reduce the occurring oxidative stress as well as inflammation. The effects of long-term use of antioxidant supplementation in sarcoidosis, using e.g. quercetin, on improvement of lung function remain to be investigated. (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT-00402623).},

As disruption of Nrf2 promotes immune cells that stimulate Th2-like immunoresponsiveness, Nrf2-deficient mice may be resistant to M. tuberculosis infection.
SETTING: Nrf2-deficient mice were infected with M. tuberculosis aerially, and the size of their granulomas and cytokine mRNA expression were compared with those of wild-type mice.
RESULTS: Significant reduction of granuloma formation and tubercle bacilli in granulomas was noted in the deficient mice 27 weeks after infection, concurrently with higher expression of IL-2 and IL-13 mRNA.
CONCLUSION: It is concluded that Nrf2 inversely regulates M. tuberculosis-induced granuloma development at the late stage.},

The aim of this study was to find out the correlation between various inflammatory models with seizures and antioxidant parameters. Fifty-four male rats were divided into three groups of colitis, adjuvant arthritis and cotton wool granuloma (CWG). Each group had three subgroups of control, model and treatment. Thalidomide was used as treatment in colitis and arthritis group, whereas etoricoxib was used in CWG group. In colitis and arthritis groups, thalidomide was administered for 3 and 17 days, respectively, whereas etoricoxib was administered for 7 days in CWG group. At the end of treatment protocols, a subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (40 mg/kg i.p.) was injected intraperitoneally to note seizure onset and score. After confirming the presence of inflammation by morphological and histological studies, plasma and brain biochemical parameters of oxidative stress were estimated. The models of colitis, arthritis and CWG were effectively produced as evidenced by morphological scores (P {\textless} 0.001). Thalidomide reduced the morphological score (P {\textless} 0.002) and seizure grade (P {\textless} 0.001), whereas increased seizure onset (P {\textless} 0.001) in the arthritis group. There was an increase in malondialdehyde levels in the brain of thalidomide-treated groups (P {\textless} 0.002) and a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) levels. There was neither improvement in seizure nor any significant changes in lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme levels in etoricoxib-treated group. Thalidomide was effective in reducing the extent of arthritis as well as reducing the seizure scoring and increasing seizure onset in the adjuvant arthritis group. As it increased lipid peroxidation and reduced SOD and GPx, further evaluation is necessary with respect to oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to examine the mutual relationship between 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) and superoxide anion generation by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cells in patients with sarcoidosis.
DESIGN: About 29 patients with sarcoidosis, 34 healthy never smokers (control group for EBC) and 15 healthy never smokers (control group for BAL) were examined. EBC was collected directly before bronchoscopy. 8-Isoprostane was measured by ELISA, and superoxide anion by colorimetry.
RESULTS: Exhaled breath condensate 8-isoprostane is increased in sarcoidosis (median, 25-75 percentile): 2.50; 2.50-3.90 versus 6.20; 2.50-16.95 pg/ml, p ≤ 0.05). Spontaneous superoxide anion release from BALF cells was significantly elevated only in patients with a high percentage of lymphocytes in BALF (6.42 ± 1.24 vs. 23.52 ± 4.30 nmol/10(6) cells, p ≤ 0.01). There were no correlations between 8-isoprostane and spontaneous or stimulated superoxide anion release.
CONCLUSIONS: We confirmed higher concentrations of EBC 8-isoprostane in sarcoidosis and higher spontaneous release of superoxide anion from BALF cells in patients with sarcoidosis. The increase of EBC 8-isoprostane is not directly related to superoxide anion released from BALF cells.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.pupt.2009.09.002},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A local redox imbalance has been reported in pulmonary sarcoidosis. However, so far no study has described a systemic redox imbalance in this context. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the systemic oxidative stress in patients with sarcoidosis and determine its relationship to treatment and indices of disease severity.
METHODS: 35 patients with histologically proven pulmonary sarcoidosis and 13 healthy volunteers were included in the study. All patients were studied during a stable phase of their disease. Systemic oxidative stress was quantified in serum with the use of a commercially available spectrophotometric method (D-ROM test) which determines overall oxidative stress, by measuring total hydroperoxides. Oxidative stress was expressed in conventional units, i.e. Carratelli Units (UCarr), where 1 UCarr corresponds to 0.8 mg/L H(2)O(2).
RESULTS: Serum oxidative stress levels were significantly higher in patients with sarcoidosis compared to those of normal subjects (390+/-25 vs 300+/-18 UCarr respectively, p=0.04). Patients not receiving systemic corticosteroids had higher levels of oxidative stress compared to steroid-treated patients (461.5+/-38 vs 315+/-20, p{\textless}0.01) and compared to controls (461.5+/-38 vs 300+/-18 UCarr, p{\textless}0.01). Oxidative stress did not correlate with diffusion lung capacity (DLCO), partial arterial oxygen tension (PaO(2)), MRC dyspnoea scale or chest X-ray stage.
CONCLUSIONS: Systemic oxidative stress is increased in patients with stable pulmonary sarcoidosis who do not receive systemic corticosteroids. This finding suggests a sustained oxidative burden even when clinical, functional and radiological criteria indicate disease stability.},

This study compares haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) extracellular activity for the first time in patients with sarcoidosis or CBD and in healthy controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Induced sputum was recovered using a standard protocol. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) were performed by conventional methods. T lymphocyte subsets (CD4 and CD8) were measured by flow activated cell shorter (FACS). The HO-1 and nitrite levels were measured by a bilirubin-biliverdin reductase-dependent reaction and Greiss reaction respectively. Ferritin and iron levels were measured by enzymatic reaction and chemiluminometric immunoassay respectively.
RESULTS: The mean percentage of lymphocytes was significantly higher in the 36 sarcoid patients compared with that in the 17 controls (P=0.001). The mean CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly higher in the sarcoid and the 10 CBD patients compared to that in controls (P=0.000 and 0.002 respectively), as was the mean HO-1 activity (P=0.045 and 0.041 respectively). The HO-1 activity did not differ with the sarcoidosis stage. The HO-1 level and PFT parameters were negatively correlated. The differences in mean nitrite, ferritin and iron levels were non-significant between the three groups. The HO-1 and ferritin levels were correlated (P=0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: We succeeded in non-invasively measuring the activity of HO-1 from cells of airways in spite of its being an intracellular enzyme. The HO-1 levels in sarcoidosis and CBD were abnormally elevated.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), capable of reducing endogenous defense levels and enhancing inflammation, is suggested to play a role in sarcoidosis. Antioxidant supplementation might offer protection against such ROS-mediated damage. A promising candidate for antioxidant supplementation is the flavonoid quercetin.
AIM: To determine the antioxidant and inflammatory status in sarcoidosis. Furthermore, the potential of quercetin to mitigate the occurring inflammation will be assessed.
METHODS: Non-smoking sarcoidosis patients and healthy controls matched for age, gender and dietary behavior were enrolled (NCT-00512967). Measurements included assessment of total plasma antioxidant capacity, vitamin C, uric acid, glutathione, basal and LPS-induced levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin (IL)-8 and -10 as well as the effect of quercetin on these levels.
RESULTS: Compared to their controls, the sarcoidosis patients displayed significantly lower total plasma antioxidant capacity, decreased levels of vitamin C, uric acid and glutathione and increased levels of basal TNFalpha and IL-8. Quercetin significantly decreased ex vivo LPS-induced TNFalpha- and IL-8 production in a concentration-dependent manner in both groups. Interestingly, this quercetin effect was more pronounced in sarcoidosis patients.
DISCUSSION: The endogenous antioxidant defense was significantly reduced in sarcoidosis, indicating that oxidative stress underlies the pathology of this disease. Furthermore, the inflammatory status was significantly enhanced in sarcoidosis. Finally, our results regarding the effect of quercetin on cytokine production imply that sarcoidosis patients might benefit from antioxidant supplementation not only by empowering the relatively low protection against ROS but also by reducing inflammation.},

We aimed to evaluate the oxidant-antioxidant balance in the pathogenesis and activity of sarcoidosis and to search if the change in the level of PON can be taken as an activity marker.
METHODS: 26 active sarcoidosis subjects aged 41.3+/-12.9 years, 37 inactive subjects aged 39.6+/-11.7 years and 48 control subjects aged 48.9+/-2.5 years were recruited in our study. Malondialdehyde (MDA), paraoxonase1 (PON1) and oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) levels in serum were analyzed by spectrophotometric, kinetic, and ELISA methods, respectively.
RESULTS: PON1 levels were significantly lower in the active disease state than both the inactive form and control groups. MDA levels were significantly higher in active sarcoidosis than both the inactive disease and control groups, and oxLDL levels were significantly higher in the active disease group than the inactive group and control group. The level of PON1 in the inactive disease group is not significantly different from the control group while the oxLDL and MDA levels of inactive group is significantly higher than the control group (p{\textless}0.001). There was a negative correlation between the PON1 activities and MDA values in both active and inactive groups (p=0.008).
CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress increases in sarcoidosis might be due to both increase in lipid peroxidation and decrease in antioxidant status (PON1) and the relationship between oxidative status and the activation of the disease should be discussed by comparing the previously known activation criteria.},

	abstract = {All six mammalian peroxiredoxins are expressed in the lung. Peroxiredoxin (Prx) VI is the isoform expressed at the highest level and its lung expression exceeds that for other organs. The predominant location of Prx VI is the cytosol and acidic organelles of Clara cells of the conducting airways and type II epithelial cells and macrophages in the alveoli. Prx I and VI show developmental induction of transcription at birth. PrxVI shares structural homology with other peroxiredoxins exhibiting a thioredoxin fold and a conserved catalytic Cys residue in the N-terminus of the protein. This enzyme is highly inducible by oxidative stress in both the neonatal and adult lung consistent with a role in antioxidant defense. Prx VI has several properties that distinguish its peroxidase activity from other peroxiredoxins: it can reduce phospholipid hydroperoxides in addition to other organic hydroperoxides and H2O2; the electron donor that serves to reduce the oxidized peroxidatic cysteine is not thioredoxin but GSH; instead of homodimerization, heterodimerization with pi-glutathione S-transferase is required for regeneration of the active enzyme. Prx VI also expresses a phospholipase A2 activity that is Ca2+-independent, maximal at acidic pH, and dependent on a serine-based catalytic triad and nucleophilic elbow at the surface of the protein. Models of altered Prx VI expression at the cellular, organ and whole animal levels have demonstrated that Prx VI functions as an important anti-oxidant enzyme with levels of protection that exceed those ascribed to GSH peroxidase (GPx1). The phospholipase A2 activity plays an important role in lung surfactant homeostasis and is responsible for the bulk of the degradation of internalized phosphatidylcholine and its resynthesis by the reacylation pathway. Expression of peroxiredoxins is elevated in several lung diseases including lung cancer, mesothelioma and sarcoidosis, although the mechanism for these alterations is not known. The unique properties of Prx VI enable it to play an important role in lung cell function.},

	abstract = {In vitro experiments have demonstrated that polyphenols exhibit antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The present study was designed to test whether dealcoholized red (DRW) and white (DWW) wines can decrease the oxidative stress associated with inflammation in vivo. Rats were fed for 15 d either a control diet or one supplemented with DRW or DWW. Finally, a granuloma was induced by subcutaneous administration of carrageenan. Although DRW showed higher antioxidant activity in vitro than DWW, both wines decreased the number of cells recruited into the granuloma pouch. Malondialdehyde decreased in plasma and inflammatory exudate from rats fed with DRW- and DWW-rich diets. Moreover, the concentration of NO increased in exudate, which correlates with the increase in the citrulline:arginine ratio. Polymorphonuclear leucocytes from the inflammatory exudate of rats fed dealcoholized wines showed decreased superoxide anion (O*2) production and increased NO production ex vivo. This change in NO production resulted from increased expression and activity of inducible NO synthase (EC 1.14.13.39). Moreover, the up regulation of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (EC 1.14.99.1) protein expression observed in rats fed the DRW-rich diet was not related to a direct effect of NO. The present results indicate that the non-alcoholic compounds of wines not only improve antioxidant status in an inflammatory situation, but also limit cell infiltration, possibly through a decrease in O*2 and an increase in NO production.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 19 patients with active lung tuberculosis and 15 patients with sarcoidosis were enrolled into the study. As a control served 15 healthy subjects. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was measured in EBC and the ends products of lipid peroxidation (TBARs) were assessed in serum.
RESULTS: The concentrations of H202 and TBARs (1022.96+/-186.02 nM and 4.22+/-0. 80 microM, respectively) were significantly higher in patients with tuberculosis as compared with the controls (398.15+/-37.10 nM and 0.48+/-0.17 microM, respectively). The patients with sarcoidosis revealed only the significantly elevated levels of hydrogen peroxide (963.30+/-105.77 nM) in breath condensate.
CONCLUSIONS: It was found that local and systemic oxidative stress were present in patients with tuberculosis, while in those with sarcoidosis existed only the local reaction.},

Spontaneous mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines and redox-active enzymes was examined in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and sarcoidosis (SARC) using RT-PCR analysis. Pulmonary oxidative stress was characterized by carbonyl-levels in the soluble BAL-fluid protein. Protein carbonyls were normal in SARC, but 2.4-fold increased in IPF. Here, the protein carbonyls correlated inversely with glutathione peroxidase mRNA. The message for IL-8 increased 14-fold in IPF and was accompanied by a marked influx of PMN, while these parameters were not altered in SARC. Levels of IL-10 transcripts increased in both diseases, but stronger in SARC (33-fold) than in IPF (22-fold), contributing to a high IL-10/IL-8 mRNA ratio in SARC (0.86) in comparison to IPF (0.07) and controls (0.04). In SARC but not in IPF, IFN-gamma mRNA was expressed at high levels and correlated inversely with the carbonyl levels. In both diseases, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 mRNA transcripts remained at baseline level. In summary, a low IL-10/IL-8 mRNA ratio was paralleled with significant oxidative stress in IPF, while a high IL-10/IL-8 ratio and enhanced IFN-gamma expression went along with a physiological redox-balance in SARC.},

Here we describe the development and application of novel bacterial RNA amplification technology to simultaneously identify key elements of both host and pathogen responses in a murine infection model. On the bacterial side, we found induction of an unusual pattern of stress response genes, a response to host-induced metal ion limitation, and a failure to achieve stationary phase in vivo. On the mammalian side, we observed the surprising induction of several genes encoding acute phase response proteins including hepcidin, haptoglobin, complement C3 and metallothionein 1 at the site of infection, as well as other mediators of innate immunity. Thus, our results reveal host-pathogen cross-talk not predicted by previous in vitro analyses and provide the framework to eavesdrop on a broad array of host-pathogen interactions in vivo. As described here, the comprehensive examination of host-pathogen interactions during an infection is critical to the discovery of novel approaches for intervention not predicted by current models.},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: 8-Isoprostane is considered an index of oxidative stress. Measurement of 8-isoprostane in the expired breath condensate, a totally noninvasive method, has not been used to explore the level of inflammation in pulmonary sarcoidosis. Therefore, the aim of our study was to measure the levels of 8-isoprostane in the expired breath condensate of patients with sarcoidosis, and to investigate the relation of 8-isoprostane level to disease activity.
PATIENTS: We investigated 30 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis (active disease, n = 14; nonactive disease, n = 16) and 12 healthy subjects as control group.
METHODS: 8-Isoprostane was measured in the expired breath condensate of all subjects, and its levels were compared between the control and sarcoidosis groups as well as between the subgroups of patients with active and nonactive disease. In the group with sarcoidosis, 8-isoprostane levels were further correlated with markers that may reflect disease activity, such as serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (sACE) level, serum calcium level, and pulmonary function test results.
RESULTS: The concentration of 8-isoprostane was increased in patients with sarcoidosis compared to control subjects (mean, 64.23 pg/mL; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 37.00 to 91.46 pg/mL; vs mean, 20.75 pg/mL; 95\% CI, 16.06 to 25.44 pg/mL; p = 0.04). The difference was primarily due to the patients with active disease, who had significantly higher levels of 8-isoprostane (mean, 111.4 pg/mL; 95\% CI, 62.56 to 160.30 pg/mL; p {\textless} 0.001) compared to patients with nonactive disease (mean, 22.94 pg/mL; 95\% CI, 15.89 to 29.99 pg/mL) or healthy subjects. 8-Isoprostane levels in patients with nonactive disease did not differ from those in healthy subjects (p {\textgreater} 0.05). In the patients with sarcoidosis, 8-isoprostane levels were positively correlated with sACE level (p {\textless} 0.0001, r = 0.69), but was not correlated with serum calcium level or pulmonary function test values.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that 8-isoprostane levels are increased in the expired breath condensate of patients with sarcoidosis and might serve as an index of disease activity.},

	abstract = {Giant cell arteritis (GCA), a vasculitis that targets medium- and large-size arteries, is ranked as a medical emergency because of its potential to cause blindness and stroke. The typical lesions, granulomas in the vessel wall, are formed by IFN-gamma-producing CD4+ T cells and macrophages. CD4+ T cells undergo in situ activation in the adventitia, where they interact with indigenous dendritic cells. Tissue injury is mediated by several distinct sets of macrophages that are committed to diverse effector functions. The dominant tissue injury in the media results from oxidative stress and leads to smooth muscle cell apoptosis and nitration of endothelial cells. Macrophage-derived growth factors are instrumental in driving the response-to-injury program of the artery that causes intimal hyperplasia and vessel occlusion. Clinical manifestations are those of tissue ischemia or a syndrome of exuberant systemic inflammation. The vascular and the systemic components of GCA contribute differentially to the disease, leading to distinct clinical phenotypes of this arteritis. Immunologically most interesting is polymyalgia rheumatica, in which the systemic component is combined with aborted vasculitis, suggesting a role for artery-specific tolerance mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Hemeoxygenase 1 (HO-1) has been implicated in the protection of lung tissue against exogenous oxidant exposure. However, the expression and cellular distribution of HO-1 in human lung continue to be poorly characterized. The localization of HO-1 was studied in histopathologically healthy lung from nonsmoking patients with a carcinoid or other lung tumor (5 cases), pulmonary sarcoidosis (13 cases), and chronic interstitial pneumonias (9 cases, usual interstitial pneumonia; 10 cases, desquamative interstitial pneumonia). Immunostaining was graded from 0 (no immunoreactivity) to +++ (intense immunoreactivity). In healthy lung, HO-1 was localized to alveolar macrophages with reactivity varying from moderate to intense, and in bronchial epithelium, alveolar epithelium, endothelium, and interstitium, the immunoreactivity was not detectable or was very low. Sarcoidosis and interstitial pneumonias showed intense HO-1 immunoreactivity in alveolar macrophages in most of the cases and weak to intense immunoreactivity in the granulomas of sarcoidosis. The immunoreactivity of interstitium was negative or weak in the fibrotic areas of the lung and also in the samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from the patients with UIP. Western blotting indicated that HO-1 is up-regulated by exposure of monocytes to formylated peptide, fMLP, which causes respiratory burst in the cells, and that inhibition of HO-1 by tin protoporphyrin potentiates the injury of fMLP-exposed cells. In conclusion, these data show differential distribution of HO-1 in human lung cells and strongly suggest the importance of HO-1, especially in the defense of alveolar macrophages in normal human lung and in the inflammatory, but not in the fibrotic, stage of interstitial lung disorders.},

The involvement of NF-kappaB is especially of interest as it is activated by oxidative stress and its activation can be modulated by antioxidant compounds. The activation of NF-kappaB can be determined by the electromobility shift assay (EMSA) with a NF-kappaB binding-site-specific probe. EMSA can also be used on human mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood, which could make the assay applicable for clinical trials. The critical steps of the EMSA are discussed, addressing some pitfalls of the assay. The procedure that can be used to express NF-kappaB activity in human subjects is evaluated.

Because most donors for living liver transplantation (LLT) are blood relatives with close HLA matches, the recurrence of PBC in transplant recipients might offer additional insights in the pathogenesis of the condition. We studied 6 women (age, 29 to 61 years) with PBC who survived LLT for at least 1 year. Tests for antimitochondrial autoantibody (AMA), antipyruvate dehydrogenase complex-E2, immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-M2, and IgM anti-M2 had confirmed the diagnosis. Donors were blood relatives in 5 instances, and one donor who was not a blood relative still had multiple HLA matches with the recipient. After LLT, we observed a decrease in AMA titers, but within 1 year, these titers increased again in 5 of the 6 patients to pre-LLT levels or greater. Immunoblotting analysis of the anti-M2 protein profile failed to show loss of bands and showed new bands in 3 of 6 patients. Histologically, strong evidence of recurrent PBC was found in 2 patients, and findings compatible with PBC were present in 1 additional patient.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disorder of unknown origin. The nuclear regulatory factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) appears to play a key role in immune and inflammatory processes such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. We hypothesized that NF-kappaB activation might be involved in the pathological process of sarcoidosis.
METHODS: Twelve sarcoidosis patients, biopsy proven, and five healthy control subjects, all nonsmokers, were studied. Blood samples were taken and routinely analysed for several parameters including the serum angiotensin converting enzyme (sACE) level. Mononuclear cells were isolated from these patients in order to quantify the NF-kappaB contents in the nuclear extract of the mononuclear cells.
RESULTS: Mononuclear cells NF-kappaB expressed per mg protein were twice as high in both untreated (n = 5) and treated (n = 7) patients with sarcoidosis compared to the control subjects (p {\textless} 0.001). In contrast, the sACE level appeared to be low in the treated patients compared to the untreated patients (p {\textless} 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the inflammation in sarcoidosis is associated with NF-kappaB activation. Moreover, the suppression of the activated NF-kappaB response by glucocorticoids seems less successful than the suppression of the sACE activity. Future studies should focus on the clinical relevance of this observation and establish the possible therapeutic consequences of the increased NF-kappaB activation in sarcoidosis.},

Compared with WT mice, increased levels of O(2)(-), NO, and the more highly reactive ONOO(-) were detected in the liver and produced by lesional cells isolated from liver granulomas of infected IL-4(-/-) mice. Concurrently, antioxidant defenses in the liver, specifically catalase levels, diminished dramatically during the course of infection in these animals. This contrasted to the situation in infected WT mice, where catalase levels remained as high as those in normal mice. Actual levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates in the livers of infected IL-4(-/-) animals are thus likely to be considerably higher than those in the livers of infected WT mice. To determine whether these changes contributed to the development of the more severe disease that characterizes infection in the IL-4(-/-) animals, we treated infected IL-4(-/-) mice with uric acid, a potent scavenger of ONOO(-). This resulted in significantly increased hepatocyte proliferation, decreased morbidity, and prolonged survival. Taken together, these data indicate that IL-4 is playing a protective role during schistosomiasis by controlling the tight regulation of the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates in the liver.},

Many giant cells contain crystalline oxalate that chemically coordinates iron on the surface of the crystal. If this iron is incompletely coordinated and capable of redox cycling, then oxalate might contribute to granuloma formation in the lung.
METHODS: Using human tissues, isolated alveolar macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells, we measured the ability of calcium oxalate to sequester iron, stimulate cytokine release and cause granuloma formation. We then studied the effects of in vivo oxalate instillation on pulmonary granuloma formation over 3 to 6 months in rats.
RESULTS: Calcium oxalate present in human sarcoid granulomas sequesters significant amounts of iron and ferritin. In alveolar macrophage cultures, oxalate accumulates iron and stimulates ferritin production and giant cell formation. In cultured respiratory epithelial cells, calcium oxalate increases the release of two interleukins (IL), IL-8 and IL-6, involved in granuloma formation by 8 to 10 fold within 24 hours. Intratracheal instillation of calcium oxalate crystals into the lungs of rats is associated with pulmonary iron and ferritin accumulation and organic carbonyl formation consistent with sustained oxidative stress. These exposures were accompanied by influx of alveolar macrophages, giant cell formation, and a granulomatous response in the lung.
CONCLUSIONS: These results support an association between calcium oxalate deposition in the lung, iron mediated oxidative stress and formation of some of the granulomas of sarcoidosis.},

F2-isoprostanes are a series of prostaglandin (PG) F2-like compounds produced in vivo independent of cyclooxygenase, as products of the radical-catalyzed lipid peroxidation. Measurement of the concentrations of F2-isoprostanes has proved to be valuable in assessing oxidative stress in vivo. The aim of this study was to measure 8-epi-PGF2alpha concentrations, one of the most abundant F2-isoprostane in humans, in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in normal subjects and to compare them to those observed in patients with CFA (n = 9), FASSc (n = 8) and sarcoidosis (n = 10). 8-epi-PGF2alpha was detectable in BAL fluid in normal subjects (9.6 +/- 0.8 pg/ml) and its concentrations were increased approximately 5-fold in patients with CFA (47.4 +/- 7.0, p {\textless} 0.001) and FASSc (43.2 +/- 3.3, p {\textless} 0. 001). 8-epi-PGF2alpha was also increased in patients with sarcoidosis, although to a lesser extent (12.0 +/- 0.70 pg/ml, p {\textless} 0. 01). No correlation between 8-epi-PGF2alpha and either lung function tests or BAL cell types was observed in any group of patients. Our study shows that the level of oxidative stress is enhanced in patients with interstitial lung diseases as reflected by increased concentrations of 8-epi-PGF2alpha in BAL fluid.},

	abstract = {Oxygen-derived free radicals, released by phagocytic cells, have been postulated to contribute to lung tissue damage. We therefore investigated oxidative damage to proteins from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as an indicator of oxidative stress and to assess antioxidant defences in the lungs. We examined BAL fluids from patients with interstitial lung diseases, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF, nonsmokers (NS) and smokers (S)), sarcoidosis (SARC, nonsmokers), and asbestosis (ASB, ex-smokers (EXS)). The oxidation of BALF proteins is accompanied by the introduction of carbonyl groups into their amino acid side-chains and can be quantitated by labeling these groups with tritiated borohydride. The total lung content of oxidized proteins recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was 0.3 +/- 0.07 nmol carbonyl.mL-1 BALF (mean +/- SEM) in the NS control group (n = 9) and tended to be increased, in the asymptomatic S group (n = 8; 0.59 +/- 0.14 nmol.mL-1). This parameter was significantly elevated both in IPF-NS (n = 14; 0.84 +/- 0.2 nmol carbonyl.mL-1 BALF) and SARC-NS (n = 15; 0.73 +/- 0.16 nmol.mL-1) as compared with the NS control. On the contrary, in smoking patients with IPF (n = 6; 0.41 +/- 0.1 nmol carbonyl.mL-1 BALF) and also in ASB-EXS (n = 6; 0.37 +/- 0.06 nmol.mL-1) it was not different from NS controls. The total amount of oxidized proteins correlated positively with the absolute number of eosinophils (EOS) in IPF-NS, IPF-S and SARC, and also with absolute polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) numbers in IPF-NS and IPF-S. In conclusion, oxidative damage of BALF proteins occurred in nonsmoking patients with IPF and SARC. The amount of oxidized bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein may provide a quantitative assessment of oxygen burden, a balance between oxidant stress and antioxidant defences.},

Further, there is lack of agreement about the benefits of deferoxamine (Dfx) in the treatment of anemia and oxidative stress during inflammation and chronic diseases. In this study, iron-dextran (Fe-dextran) or Dfx was administered subcutaneously during the acute and chronic phases of carrageenan-induced granuloma. Several parameters related to iron metabolism, inflammatory cell activity, and lipid peroxidation were measured in liver, plasma, and the inflammatory exudate. Treatment with Fe-dextran increased iron content in plasma and in stores, increased production of superoxide anion (O2-) by inflammatory cells and lipid peroxidation, and also altered the inflammatory process. Dfx mobilized iron from stores without modifying essential parameters related to anemia or to the level of lipid peroxidation induced by inflammation. We conclude that treatment with Fe-dextran had a beneficial effect on recovery from the anemia of inflammation. Nevertheless, the high levels of loosely-bound iron found after Fe-dextran treatment in plasma and in exudate contribute to the increase in oxidative stress. Dfx treatment had no effect on anemia or on lipid peroxidation.},

In Gram-negative bacteria, the OxyR protein is a critical component of the oxidative stress response. OxyR is both a sensor of reactive oxygen species and a transcriptional activator, inducing expression of detoxifying enzymes such as catalase/hydroperoxidase and alkyl hydroperoxidase. We have characterized the responses of various mycobacteria to hydrogen peroxide both phenotypically and at the levels of gene and protein expression. Only the saprophytic Mycobacterium smegmatis induced a protective oxidative stress response analogous to the OxyR response of Gram-negative bacteria. Under similar conditions, the pathogenic mycobacteria exhibited a limited, nonprotective response, which in the case of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was restricted to induction of a single protein, KatG. We have also isolated DNA sequences homologous to oxyR and ahpC from M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium. While the M. avium oxyR appears intact, the oxyR homologue of M. tuberculosis contains numerous deletions and frameshifts and is probably nonfunctional. Apparently the response of pathogenic mycobacteria to oxidative stress differs significantly from the inducible OxyR response of other bacteria.},

On the other hand, a broad utilization of the biopsy technique may be championed by those who believe that the light and electron microscopic characteristics of the tissue are important and that the biochemical features of the tissue may hold important clues to the diagnosis and therapy of dilated cardiomyopathy. The popularity of endomyocardial biopsy arises from the ease and safety of the procedure. Light microscopy of the tissue is useful not only to diagnose myocarditis but also to discover infiltrative cardiomyopathies and to characterize the dilated cardiomyopathies by the amount of fibrosis and cellular hypertrophy. Electron microscopy supplies more detailed information on the myofibrils, nuclei, tubular structures, mitochondria, glycogen, and lipofuscin. At present, these data are clinically applicable only to the anthracycline cardiomyopathies. On an investigational basis, subcellular characteristics may help us better understand the etiology and pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy. The greatest promise lies in the biochemical assessment of tissue, which may uncover single or multiple biochemical abnormalities in heart failure. Although the clinical usefulness of endomyocardial biopsy is quite restricted at present, its future looks quite promising.},

The numerical density of lysosomes decreased slightly in tissue monocytes compared with blood monocytes but showed a pronounced increase during the formation of epithelioid cells. The lysosomal compartments of epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells resembled each other very closely, but the giant cells obviously produced additional lysosomes of small diameter (80-120 nm). Phagocytic macrophages displayed a total numerical density of lysosomes similar to that of tissue monocytes but the mean diameter of the lysosomes was markedly greater. Thus the volume density of lysosomes was highest in phagocytic macrophages. The blood monocytes exhibited the smallest lysosomal compartment. In tissue monocytes, epithelioid cells, and multinucleated giant cells the volume densities of the lysosomes were greater than in blood monocytes and remained relatively constant because the increase in numerical density was counterbalanced by a decrease in mean granule diameter. We found only minor differences in mitochondrial volume densities among the five cell populations. The shape of the mitochondria, however, changed steadily from short rotational ellipsoids in the blood monocytes to rather elongated and slender bodies in the multinucleated giant cells. The results suggest that epithelioid cells and multinucleated giant cells are active cells which may contribute by their specific performances, to the immunologic microenvironment of the granuloma.},

Indeed, and entire spectrum from mononuclear infiltrates to the epithelioid sarcoidal types is seen. The electron microscopic findings include histiocytes with membrane activity, well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum, large mitochondria, and numerous lysosomes. Pathcy damage of collagen and elastic fibers with the presence of vesicles, lysosomes, and cytoplasmic debris are demonstrated. The histochemical and ultrastructural studies localized acid phosphatase in the primary lysosomes and the routh endoplasmic membrane. The presence of fibrin deposition confirmed our previous immunofluorescence results.},

The examination of giant cells revealed an abundance of cell organelles, especially mitochondria. Apart from typical stromal cells, such as fibroblasts, macrophages, and mast cells, clusters of stromal "light" cells were often found with an intimate relation between their cell membranes. The role and function of these cells is not well known. Between fibroblasts of regular appearance with a small number of cytoplasmic organelles, others were found with an incrased number of mitochondria. These cells often formed aggregates. This suggests that giant cells develop through the association of stroma fibroblast cells.},

Tumor cells did not differ from normal cells with regard to one system of organells being more highly developed than the other, but they did from the point of view of different relations between the protein-synthesizing and energetic apparatuses. Also, tumor cells were found to be less differentiated than normal, and more malignant tumors show no less differentiation than more benign ones.

In one animal nodules occurred in the forepaws during the tenth week. The histology of the latter showed an epithelioid granuloma with multinucleate giant cells, while in all the others macrophages and monocytes highly parasitized with leishmania bodies, formed the main elements in the granulomatous infiltrate. Lesions seem to develop in the cool, non-hairy areas of the integument and those areas of the nasal mucosa which are constantly bombarded by the inhaled cool air stream. The anterior nasal mucosa, with its leaking venular network, its cool timperature, relative stasis and hypoxia probably provides the optimum micro-environment for the localization, survival and multiplication of the leishmanial protozoon.},

	abstract = {Organized epithelioid cell granulomas were produced experimentally by injecting intradermally dilute suspensions of zirconium and beryllium salts into individuals who had been previously sensitized to these metals. Biopsies were obtained at intervals of between 5 days and 13 months later, and the specimens were fixed and prepared for light and electron microscopy. Tritiated thymidine was injected into a number of the granulomas; the biopsy specimens were secured from 40 minutes to 2 or more weeks later, and the tissues were processed for light microscopic autoradiography. Giant cells occurred commonly, both within organized tubercles and in relation to areas of necrosis, and had markedly different cytoplasmic features from typical secretory epithelioid cells which enabled them to be readily recognized at scanning magnifications. The characteristic hallmark of these giant cells was the presence of myriads of small mitochondria adjacent to nuclei with numerous membrane-lined vesicles in the center of the cell. Giant cells occurred mainly in edematous disrupted tubercles. In these tubercles, epithelioid cells contained cytoplasmic components more like giant cells. Direct evidence of cell fusion was not seen, although fusion of membranes seemed to occur between cells having similar cytoplasmic features. The failure to find labeled nuclei in any giant cells 40 minutes after injection of tritiated thymidine indicates that normal nuclear division does not occur within giant cells. We postulate that epithelioid cells containing vesicles develop in damaged and necrotic areas, and that mainly this type of epithelioid cell fuses to form giant cells.},

Compromised CL progesterone production is a potential risk factor for prenatal development. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play diverse roles in mammalian reproductive biology. ROS-induced oxidative damage and subsequent adverse developmental outcomes constitute important issues in reproductive medicine. The CL is considered to be highly exposed to locally produced ROS due to its high blood vasculature and steroidogenic activity. ROS-induced apoptotic cell death is involved in the mechanisms of CL regression that occurs at the end of the non-fertile cycle. Luteal ROS production and propagation depend upon several regulating factors, including luteal antioxidants, steroid hormones and cytokines, and their crosstalk. However, it is unknown which of these factors have the greatest contribution to the maintenance of CL integrity and function during the oestrous/menstrual cycle. There is evidence to suggest that antioxidants play important roles in CL rescue from luteolysis when pregnancy ensues. As luteal phase defect impacts fertility by preventing implantation and early conceptus development in livestock and humans, this review attempts to address the importance of ROS-scavenging antioxidant enzymes in the control of mammalian CL function and integrity. The corpus luteum (CL) is a transient endocrine organ that develops after ovulation from the ovulated follicle during each reproductive cycle. The main function of the CL is the production and secretion of progesterone which is necessary for embryonic implantation and development. Compromised CL progesterone production is a potential risk factor for prenatal development and pregnancy outcomes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are natural by-products of cellular respiration and metabolism, play diverse roles in mammalian reproductive biology. ROS-induced oxidative damage and subsequent development of adverse pregnancy outcomes constitute important issues in reproductive medicine. Before the end of the first trimester, a high rate of human and animal conceptions end in spontaneous abortion and most of these losses occur at the time of implantation in association with ROS-induced oxidative damage. Every cell in the body is normally able to defend itself against the oxidative damage caused by the ROS. The cellular antioxidant enzymes constitute the first line of defence against the toxic effects of ROS. The CL is considered to be highly exposed to locally produced ROS due to its high blood vasculature and metabolic activity. There is now evidence to suggest that cellular antioxidants play important roles in CL rescue from regression when pregnancy ensues.

Over the last years, six homologs of the cytochrome subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase were found: NOX1, NOX3, NOX4, NOX5, DUOX1, and DUOX2. Together with the phagocyte NADPH oxidase itself (NOX2/gp91phox), the homologs are now referred to as the NOX family of NADPH oxidases. These enzymes share the capacity to transport electrons across the plasma membrane and to generate superoxide and other downstream reactive oxygen species (ROS). Activation mechanisms and tissue distribution of the different members of the family are markedly different. The physiological functions of NOX family enzymes include host defense, posttranlational processing of proteins, cellular signaling, regulation of gene expression, and cell differentiation. NOX enzymes also contribute to a wide range of pathological processes. NOX deficiency may lead to immunosuppresion, lack of otoconogenesis, or hypothyroidism. Increased NOX actvity also contributes to a large number or pathologies, in particular cardiovascular diseases and neurodegeneration.

	abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS, e.g. nitric oxide, NO(*)) are well recognised for playing a dual role as both deleterious and beneficial species. ROS and RNS are normally generated by tightly regulated enzymes, such as NO synthase (NOS) and NAD(P)H oxidase isoforms, respectively. Overproduction of ROS (arising either from mitochondrial electron-transport chain or excessive stimulation of NAD(P)H) results in oxidative stress, a deleterious process that can be an important mediator of damage to cell structures, including lipids and membranes, proteins, and DNA. In contrast, beneficial effects of ROS/RNS (e.g. superoxide radical and nitric oxide) occur at low/moderate concentrations and involve physiological roles in cellular responses to noxia, as for example in defence against infectious agents, in the function of a number of cellular signalling pathways, and the induction of a mitogenic response. Ironically, various ROS-mediated actions in fact protect cells against ROS-induced oxidative stress and re-establish or maintain "redox balance" termed also "redox homeostasis". The "two-faced" character of ROS is clearly substantiated. For example, a growing body of evidence shows that ROS within cells act as secondary messengers in intracellular signalling cascades which induce and maintain the oncogenic phenotype of cancer cells, however, ROS can also induce cellular senescence and apoptosis and can therefore function as anti-tumourigenic species. This review will describe the: (i) chemistry and biochemistry of ROS/RNS and sources of free radical generation; (ii) damage to DNA, to proteins, and to lipids by free radicals; (iii) role of antioxidants (e.g. glutathione) in the maintenance of cellular "redox homeostasis"; (iv) overview of ROS-induced signaling pathways; (v) role of ROS in redox regulation of normal physiological functions, as well as (vi) role of ROS in pathophysiological implications of altered redox regulation (human diseases and ageing). Attention is focussed on the ROS/RNS-linked pathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, hypertension, ischemia/reperfusion injury, diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease), rheumatoid arthritis, and ageing. Topics of current debate are also reviewed such as the question whether excessive formation of free radicals is a primary cause or a downstream consequence of tissue injury.},

	abstract = {Background
Diagnostic and treatment approaches for sarcoidosis have changed dramatically over the past decade. Yet, the most recent reports of trends in hospitalizations of sarcoidosis patients are over ten years old. The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of sarcoidosis among hospitalized patients and to analyze recent trends and seasonality of hospitalizations in sarcoidosis patients.

Methods
We performed a retrospective cohort study of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 1998 through 2008. We identified all hospitalizations with a primary or secondary diagnosis of sarcoidosis (ICD-9-CM code 135). Incidence was modeled as a seasonal time series about a linear trend.

Results
Time series analysis of the monthly number of hospitalizations revealed a distinct positive linear trend. Over the study period, the number of hospitalized patients with sarcoidosis increased from 37,516 to 70,947 cases. Trends were most pronounced in patients older than 55 years (p {\textless} 0.0001), African Americans (p {\textless} 0.0001), females (p = 0.0289), and non-Medicaid populations (p {\textless} 0.0001). Hospitalizations are seasonal with highest incidence in January through March.

Conclusions
Hospitalizations among sarcoidosis patients have almost doubled during the past decade, with disproportionate rate increases in African Americans, women, and older patients. The rate also increases among patients with insurance other than Medicaid. This study indicates the need for heightened surveillance of sarcoidosis patients given the unknown consequences of evolving treatment approaches. Our results point to a need for research investigating risk factors for hospitalization, including medications, co-morbidities, demographics, and socioeconomic status.},

	abstract = {Background \& aims
Oxidative stress and low antioxidant levels are implicated in the aetiology of sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease. Quercetin is a potent dietary antioxidant that also displays anti-inflammatory activities. Consequently, the aim is to examine the effect of quercetin supplementation on markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in sarcoidosis.
Methods
A double-blind intervention study has been conducted with two groups of non-smoking, un-treated sarcoidosis patients, matched for age and gender. One group was given 4x500 mg quercetin (n = 12) orally within 24 h, the other one placebo (n = 6). Plasma malondialdehyde levels were used as marker of oxidative damage, plasma ratios of TNFα/IL-10 and IL-8/IL-10 as pro-inflammatory markers.
Results
Quercetin supplementation improved the antioxidant defence, indicated by the increased total plasma antioxidant capacity. Moreover, quercetin supplementation also reduced markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in the blood of sarcoidosis patients. The effects of quercetin supplementation appeared to be more pronounced when the levels of the oxidative stress and inflammation markers were higher at baseline.
Conclusions
Sarcoidosis patients might benefit from the use of antioxidants, such as quercetin, to reduce the occurring oxidative stress as well as inflammation. The effects of long-term use of antioxidant supplementation in sarcoidosis, using e.g. quercetin, on improvement of lung function remain to be investigated. (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT-00402623).},

It ranks second after malaria, with a significant health and socio-economic impact in the developing countries. The objective of this study was to assess the anti-schistosomal impact of Ziziphus spina-christi leaf extract (ZLE) on Schistosoma mansoni-induced liver fibrosis in CD-1 Swiss male albino mice. S. mansoni infection was achieved by dipping of mouse tails in schistosomal cercariae. ZLE treatment was initiated at 46 days post-infection by administering a dose of the extract on a daily basis for 10 consecutive days. S. mansoni infection resulted in liver granuloma and fibrosis, with a drastic elevation in liver function factors, nitric oxide, and lipid peroxidation, which were associated with a reduction in glutathione content and substantial inhibition of antioxidant enzyme activities compared to those of the control. Induction of hepatic granuloma, oxidative stress, and fibrosis in the liver was controlled by ZLE administration, which also produced inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase-9, alpha-smooth muscle actin, transforming growth factor-β, and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases expressions. In addition, the S. mansoni-infected group exhibited an increase in Bax and caspase-3 levels and a decrease in Bcl-2 level. However, treatment with ZLE mainly mitigated apoptosis in the liver. Thus, the findings of this study revealed that Ziziphus spina-christi had anti-apoptotic, anti-fibrotic, antioxidant, and protective effects on S. mansoni-induced liver wounds. The benefits of Ziziphus spina-christi extract on S. mansoni were partly partially mediated by enhancing anti-fibrinogenic and nuclear factor erythroid 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways.},

Excisional biopsy of the brain mass showed chronic non-caseating granulomatous inflammation with epitheloid cells that was consistent with sarcoidosis. Treatment with high dose-steroids led to significant clinical improvement. At a two-year follow-up, there were no signs of systemic disease or recurrence of the meningeal mass.

	abstract = {Objective The contemporary diagnosis of paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNSs) requires an increasing understanding of their clinical, immunologic, and oncologic heterogeneity. The 2004 PNS criteria are partially outdated due to advances in PNS research in the last 16 years leading to the identification of new phenotypes and antibodies that have transformed the diagnostic approach to PNS. Here, we propose updated diagnostic criteria for PNS.
Methods A panel of experts developed by consensus a modified set of diagnostic PNS criteria for clinical decision making and research purposes. The panel reappraised the 2004 criteria alongside new knowledge on PNS obtained from published and unpublished data generated by the different laboratories involved in the project.
Results The panel proposed to substitute “classical syndromes” with the term “high-risk phenotypes” for cancer and introduce the concept of “intermediate-risk phenotypes.” The term “onconeural antibody” was replaced by “high risk” ({\textgreater}70\% associated with cancer) and “intermediate risk” (30\%–70\% associated with cancer) antibodies. The panel classified 3 levels of evidence for PNS: definite, probable, and possible. Each level can be reached by using the PNS-Care Score, which combines clinical phenotype, antibody type, the presence or absence of cancer, and time of follow-up. With the exception of opsoclonus-myoclonus, the diagnosis of definite PNS requires the presence of high- or intermediate-risk antibodies. Specific recommendations for similar syndromes triggered by immune checkpoint inhibitors are also provided.
Conclusions The proposed criteria and recommendations should be used to enhance the clinical care of patients with PNS and to encourage standardization of research initiatives addressing PNS.},

	abstract = {Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are the immune-mediated effects of a remote cancer and are characterised by an autoantibody response against antigens expressed by the tumour. Classically, well-characterised ‘onconeuronal’ antibodies target intracellular antigens and hence cannot access their antigens across intact cell membranes. The pathogenic mediators are likely to be neuronal-specific T cells. There is a variable response to immunotherapies and the clinical syndrome helps to direct the search for a specific set of tumours. By contrast, many newly emerging autoantibodies with oncological associations target cell surface epitopes and can exert direct pathogenic effects on both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Patients with these cell-surface directed autoantibodies often clearly respond to immunotherapies. Overall, the clinical, serological and oncological features in an individual patient help to determine the clinical relevance of the syndrome and hence guide its management. We summarise current knowledge and a practical approach to the investigation, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of patients with suspected PNS.},

To highlight potential pitfalls in diagnosis and management of patients with concomitant gout and septic arthritis.

Methods:
Presentation of two patients with concomitant gout and septic arthritis, the latter caused by Streptococcus agalactiae and Staphylococcus aureus, in one patient each. We also reviewed the English language literature on PubMed for similar cases.

Results:
Data on concurrent gout and septic arthritis is limited. Three case series of 14, 25, and 30 patients each where identified. The coexistence of septic arthritis and gout is an infrequent condition. Clinical appearance of the two diseases may be very similar and the presence of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals per se cannot exclude infection. On the other hand, patients with chronic tophaceous gout are prone to infection of MSU tophi and the development of biofilms on the latter may render the eradication of microbes particularly difficult. Vice versa, persistent activation of the immune system fuelled by the infection, together with prolonged hospitalisation and immobilisation, may increase the risk for a gout flare, thus initiating a vicious cycle.

Conclusion:
In patients with gout, a high index of suspicion for infection is needed by treating physicians, because septic arthritis is a medical emergency which can lead to rapid joint destruction.},

	abstract = {Objectives To provide an update of the EULAR rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management recommendations addressing the most recent developments in the field.
Methods An international task force was formed and solicited three systematic literature research activities on safety and efficacy of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and glucocorticoids (GCs). The new evidence was discussed in light of the last update from 2019. A predefined voting process was applied to each overarching principle and recommendation. Levels of evidence and strengths of recommendation were assigned to and participants finally voted on the level of agreement with each item.
Results The task force agreed on 5 overarching principles and 11 recommendations concerning use of conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs (methotrexate (MTX), leflunomide, sulfasalazine); GCs; biological (b) DMARDs (tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, infliximab including biosimilars), abatacept, rituximab, tocilizumab, sarilumab and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs, namely the Janus kinase inhibitors tofacitinib, baricitinib, filgotinib, upadacitinib. Guidance on monotherapy, combination therapy, treatment strategies (treat-to-target) and tapering in sustained clinical remission is provided. Safety aspects, including risk of major cardiovascular events (MACEs) and malignancies, costs and sequencing of b/tsDMARDs were all considered. Initially, MTX plus GCs is recommended and on insufficient response to this therapy within 3–6 months, treatment should be based on stratification according to risk factors; With poor prognostic factors (presence of autoantibodies, high disease activity, early erosions or failure of two csDMARDs), any bDMARD should be added to the csDMARD; after careful consideration of risks of MACEs, malignancies and/or thromboembolic events tsDMARDs may also be considered in this phase. If the first bDMARD (or tsDMARD) fails, any other bDMARD (from another or the same class) or tsDMARD (considering risks) is recommended. With sustained remission, DMARDs may be tapered but should not be stopped. Levels of evidence and levels of agreement were high for most recommendations.
Conclusions These updated EULAR recommendations provide consensus on RA management including safety, effectiveness and cost.},

	abstract = {Background Cohort studies are essential to provide better understanding of the prognosis of acute monoarthritis, but few studies have focused on this issue.
Objectives To describe the joint distribution in a cohort of patients with new-onset monoarthritis, and to study the outcome after two years, according to the initial joint involved.
Methods 1084 patients (age 18-75 years) with arthritis of less than 16 weeks duration were included in the NOR-VEAC study from 2004 to 2010. Patients with crystal arthritis and osteoarthritis were not included. 354 patients (33\%) had monoarthritis (clinical synovitis in one joint) at baseline. Follow-up data were available for 331 patients (94\%), and 185 (52\%) had 2-year follow-up data.
Results Duration of joint swelling [median (25-75 percentiles)] among the 331 patients with monoarthritis was 22 (7-48) days, mean (SD) age 45 (14) years, 51.2\% were females, 5.9\% anti-CCP positive, 10.1\% anti-CCP and/or RF positive). The most frequently affected joints were knees (50.5\%), ankles (17.5\%) and wrists (13.9\%). 12 patients (3.6\%) fulfilled the 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at baseline; these had mostly wrist or small joint involvement. Two patients with clinical synovitis of the knee fulfilled the criteria as a result of one more tender joint. During follow-up 10 additional patients fulfilled the criteria, 8 of whom presented with large joint arthritis (table). No patients with ankle monoarthritis ever fulfilled the criteria, nor progressed to a clinical diagnosis of RA within 2 years of follow-up. 57 patients (17.2\%) were diagnosed with reactive arthritis at baseline, 10 patients (3\%) with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and during follow-up only 4 more patients were classified as PsA. The patients diagnosed with PsA had monoarthritis of the knee (n=8), hand (n=2), wrist (n=2), elbow (n=1) and foot (n=1) at presentation. In addition two patients with arthritis of the knee and ankle were diagnosed with axial spondyloarthritis. In 236 patients (71\%) the arthritis had resolved at last follow-up without DMARD treatment. 51 patients (15.4\%) had DMARDs prescribed, 97 (29.3\%) received intra-articular corticosteroids and 73 (22\%) systemic corticosteroids. {\textless}img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Figure" src="https://ard.bmj.com/content/annrheumdis/72/Suppl\_3/A342.1/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="170"/{\textgreater}Download figure Open in new tab Download powerpoint
Conclusions Few patients with acute or recent onset monoarthritis seem to develop chronic inflammatory joint disease over two years. Patients with ankle monoarthritis had an especially low likelihood of developing RA or other chronic rheumatic diseases.

	abstract = {Objectives To describe current management and outcome of native joint septic arthritis (NJSA) in French rheumatology departments.
Methods For this retrospective, nationwide multicentric study, 127 French rheumatology departments were contacted to report up to 12 cases of NJSA that occurred between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017. Characteristics, diagnosis procedures, therapeutic management and outcome were recorded.
Results Overall, 362 patients were included (mean age 64.0±18.6 years, median Charlson comorbidity index 3.5 (0–14)). Knee was the most frequent site (n=160 (38.9\%)), and Staphylococcus sp (n=185 (51.4\%)), the most frequent pathogen. All patients received antibiotics for a mean duration of 46.8 (±22.0) days, including intravenous route for a mean of 17.2 (±15.4) days. Management was heterogeneous. Surgical procedure was performed in 171 (48.3\%), joint immobilisation in 128 (43.8\%). During follow-up, 91 (28.3\%) patients have had serious complications and 28 (9.2\%) of them died. Factors associated with 1-year mortality were age (OR 1.08, 95\% CI 1.04 to 1.13; p{\textless}0.001), Charlson’s index (OR 1.30, 95\% CI 1.06 to 1.58; p=0.012), presence of bacteraemia (OR 4.02, 95\% CI 1.35 to 11.99; p=0.008), antibiotic use in the previous 3 months (OR 3.32, 95\% CI 1.11 to 9.87; p=0.029) and Staphylococcus aureus NJSA compared with Streptococcus sp. NJSA (OR 7.24, 95\% CI 1.26 to 41.68, p=0.027). The complete recovery with no adverse joint outcome at 1 year was observed in n=125/278 patients (55.0\%).
Conclusion Prognosis of NJSA remained severe with a high rate of morbimortality. Its management was very heterogeneous. This study highlights the importance of the new French recommendations, published after the completion of the study, in order to facilitate NJSA management.},

	abstract = {Septic arthritis (SA) in an adult native joint is a rare condition but a diagnostic emergency due to the morbidity and mortality and the functional risk related to structural damage. Current management varies and the recommendations available are dated. The French Rheumatology Society (SFR) Bone and Joint Infection Working Group, together with the French Language Infectious Diseases Society (SPILF) and the French Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery Society (SOFCOT) have worked according to the HAS methodology to devise clinical practice recommendations to diagnose and treat SA in an adult native joint. One new focus is on the importance of microbiological documentation (blood cultures and joint aspiration) before starting antibiotic treatment, looking for differential diagnoses (microcrystal detection), the relevance of a joint ultrasound to guide aspiration, and the indication to perform a reference X-ray. A cardiac ultrasound is indicated only in cases of SA involving Staphylococcus aureus, oral streptococci, Streptococcus gallolyticus or Enterococcus faecalis, or when infective endocarditis is clinically suspected. Regarding treatment, we stress the importance of medical and surgical collaboration. Antibiotic therapies (drugs and durations) are presented in the form of didactic tables according to the main bacteria in question (staphylococci, streptococci and gram-negative rods). Probabilistic antibiotic therapy should only be used for patients with serious symptoms. Lastly, non-drug treatments such as joint drainage and early physical therapy are the subject of specific recommendations.},

	abstract = {Background New drugs and new evidence concerning the use of established treatments have become available since the publication of the first European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of gout, in 2006. This situation has prompted a systematic review and update of the 2006 recommendations.
Methods The EULAR task force consisted of 15 rheumatologists, 1 radiologist, 2 general practitioners, 1 research fellow, 2 patients and 3 experts in epidemiology/methodology from 12 European countries. A systematic review of the literature concerning all aspects of gout treatments was performed. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated by use of a Delphi consensus approach.
Results Three overarching principles and 11 key recommendations were generated. For the treatment of flare, colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral or intra-articular steroids or a combination are recommended. In patients with frequent flare and contraindications to colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids, an interleukin-1 blocker should be considered. In addition to education and a non-pharmacological management approach, urate-lowering therapy (ULT) should be considered from the first presentation of the disease, and serum uric acid (SUA) levels should be maintained at{\textless}6 mg/dL (360 µmol/L) and {\textless}5 mg/dL (300 µmol/L) in those with severe gout. Allopurinol is recommended as first-line ULT and its dosage should be adjusted according to renal function. If the SUA target cannot be achieved with allopurinol, then febuxostat, a uricosuric or combining a xanthine oxidase inhibitor with a uricosuric should be considered. For patients with refractory gout, pegloticase is recommended.
Conclusions These recommendations aim to inform physicians and patients about the non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments for gout and to provide the best strategies to achieve the predefined urate target to cure the disease.},

	abstract = {Objectives To update the EULAR recommendations for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) based on emerging new evidence.
Methods An international Task Force formed the questions for the systematic literature reviews (January 2018–December 2022), followed by formulation and finalisation of the statements after a series of meetings. A predefined voting process was applied to each overarching principle and recommendation. Levels of evidence and strengths of recommendation were assigned, and participants finally provided their level of agreement with each item.
Results The Task Force agreed on 5 overarching principles and 13 recommendations, concerning the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), glucocorticoids (GC), immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs) (including methotrexate, mycophenolate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide (CYC)), calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, voclosporin) and biologics (belimumab, anifrolumab, rituximab). Advice is also provided on treatment strategies and targets of therapy, assessment of response, combination and sequential therapies, and tapering of therapy. HCQ is recommended for all patients with lupus at a target dose 5 mg/kg real body weight/day, considering the individual’s risk for flares and retinal toxicity. GC are used as ‘bridging therapy’ during periods of disease activity; for maintenance treatment, they should be minimised to equal or less than 5 mg/day (prednisone equivalent) and, when possible, withdrawn. Prompt initiation of ISDs (methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate) and/or biological agents (anifrolumab, belimumab) should be considered to control the disease and facilitate GC tapering/discontinuation. CYC and rituximab should be considered in organ-threatening and refractory disease, respectively. For active lupus nephritis, GC, mycophenolate or low-dose intravenous CYC are recommended as anchor drugs, and add-on therapy with belimumab or CNIs (voclosporin or tacrolimus) should be considered. Updated specific recommendations are also provided for cutaneous, neuropsychiatric and haematological disease, SLE-associated antiphospholipid syndrome, kidney protection, as well as preventative measures for infections, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease.
Conclusion The updated recommendations provide consensus guidance on the management of SLE, combining evidence and expert opinion.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease is prevalent and has diverse presentations, but there are no validated classification criteria for this symptomatic arthritis. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and EULAR have developed the first-ever validated classification criteria for symptomatic CPPD disease.
METHODS: Supported by the ACR and EULAR, a multinational group of investigators followed established methodology to develop these disease classification criteria. The group generated lists of candidate items and refined their definitions, collected de-identified patient profiles, evaluated strengths of associations between candidate items and CPPD disease, developed a classification criteria framework, and used multi-criterion decision analysis to define criteria weights and a classification threshold score. The criteria were validated in an independent cohort.
RESULTS: Among patients with joint pain, swelling, or tenderness (entry criterion) whose symptoms are not fully explained by an alternative disease (exclusion criterion), the presence of crowned dens syndrome or calcium pyrophosphate crystals in synovial fluid are sufficient to classify a patient as having CPPD disease. In the absence of these findings, a score {\textgreater}56 points using weighted criteria, comprising clinical features, associated metabolic disorders, and results of laboratory and imaging investigations, can be used to classify as CPPD disease. These criteria had a sensitivity of 92.2\% and specificity of 87.9\% in the derivation cohort (190 CPPD cases, 148 mimickers), whereas sensitivity was 99.2\% and specificity was 92.5\% in the validation cohort (251 CPPD cases, 162 mimickers).
CONCLUSION: The 2023 ACR/EULAR CPPD disease classification criteria have excellent performance characteristics and will facilitate research in this field.},

This prompted a systematic review and update of the 2006 recommendations. A systematic review of the literature concerning all aspects of gout diagnosis was performed. Recommendations were formulated using a Delphi consensus approach. Eight key recommendations were generated. A search for crystals in synovial fluid or tophus aspirates is recommended in every person with suspected gout, because demonstration of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals allows a definite diagnosis of gout. There was consensus that a number of suggestive clinical features support a clinical diagnosis of gout. These are monoarticular involvement of a foot or ankle joint (especially the first metatarsophalangeal joint); previous episodes of similar acute arthritis; rapid onset of severe pain and swelling; erythema; male gender and associated cardiovascular diseases and hyperuricaemia. When crystal identification is not possible, it is recommended that any atypical presentation should be investigated by imaging, in particular with ultrasound to seek features suggestive of MSU crystal deposition (double contour sign and tophi). There was consensus that a diagnosis of gout should not be based on the presence of hyperuricaemia alone. There was also a strong recommendation that all people with gout should be systematically assessed for presence of associated comorbidities and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, as well as for risk factors for chronic hyperuricaemia. Eight updated, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the diagnosis of gout are proposed.},

Methods Following the EULAR Standardised Operating Procedures, two systematic literature reviews were conducted on non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment of axSpA. In a task force meeting, the evidence was presented, discussed, and overarching principles and recommendations were updated, followed by voting.
Results Five overarching principles and 15 recommendations with a focus on personalised medicine were agreed: eight remained unchanged from the previous recommendations; three with minor edits on nomenclature; two with relevant updates (\#9, 12); two newly formulated (\#10, 11). The first five recommendations focus on treatment target and monitoring, non-pharmacological management and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as first-choice pharmacological treatment. Recommendations 6–8 deal with analgesics and discourage long-term glucocorticoids and conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for pure axial involvement. Recommendation 9 describes the indication of biological DMARDs (bDMARDs, that is, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i)) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs, ie, Janus kinase inhibitors) for patients who have Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score ≥2.1 and failed ≥2 NSAIDs and also have either elevated C reactive protein, MRI inflammation of sacroiliac joints or radiographic sacroiliitis. Current practice is to start a TNFi or IL-17i. Recommendation 10 addresses extramusculoskeletal manifestations with TNF monoclonal antibodies preferred for recurrent uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease, and IL-17i for significant psoriasis. Treatment failure should prompt re-evaluation of the diagnosis and consideration of the presence of comorbidities (\#11). If active axSpA is confirmed, switching to another b/tsDMARD is recommended (\#12). Tapering, rather than immediate discontinuation of a bDMARD, can be considered in patients in sustained remission (\#13). The last recommendations (\#14, 15) deal with surgery and spinal fractures.
Conclusions The 2022 ASAS-EULAR recommendations provide up-to-date guidance on the management of patients with axSpA.},

	abstract = {Objective To update the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
Methods According to the EULAR standardised operating procedures, a systematic literature review was followed by a consensus meeting to develop this update involving 28 international taskforce members in May 2019. Levels of evidence and strengths of recommendations were determined.
Results The updated recommendations comprise 6 overarching principles and 12 recommendations. The overarching principles address the nature of PsA and diversity of both musculoskeletal and non-musculoskeletal manifestations; the need for collaborative management and shared decision-making is highlighted. The recommendations provide a treatment strategy for pharmacological therapies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and local glucocorticoid injections are proposed as initial therapy; for patients with arthritis and poor prognostic factors, such as polyarthritis or monoarthritis/oligoarthritis accompanied by factors such as dactylitis or joint damage, rapid initiation of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs is recommended. If the treatment target is not achieved with this strategy, a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) targeting tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-17A or IL-12/23 should be initiated, taking into account skin involvement if relevant. If axial disease predominates, a TNF inhibitor or IL-17A inhibitor should be started as first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug. Use of Janus kinase inhibitors is addressed primarily after bDMARD failure. Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibition is proposed for patients in whom these other drugs are inappropriate, generally in the context of mild disease. Drug switches and tapering in sustained remission are addressed.
Conclusion These recommendations provide stakeholders with an updated consensus on the pharmacological management of PsA, based on a combination of evidence and expert opinion.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To develop evidence-based recommendations for management of calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD).
METHODS: A multidisciplinary guideline development group of 15 experts, representing 10 European countries, generated key propositions for management of CPPD using a Delphi consensus approach. For each recommendation research evidence was searched systematically. Whenever possible, the effect size and number needed to treat for efficacy and RR or OR for side effects were calculated for individual treatment modalities. Strength of recommendation was assessed by the European League Against Rheumatism visual analogue scale.
RESULTS: Nine key recommendations were generated, including topics for general management, treatment of acute attacks, prophylaxis against recurrent acute attacks and management of chronic symptoms. It was recommended that optimal treatment requires both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments. For acute CPP crystal arthritis, cool packs, temporary rest and joint aspiration combined with steroid injection are often sufficient. For prophylaxis or chronic inflammatory arthritis with CPPD, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with gastroprotective treatment and/or low-dose colchicine 0.5-1.0 mg daily may be used. Other recommendations included parenteral or oral corticosteroid for acute CPP arthritis in those unresponsive or unsuited to other measures, and low-dose corticosteroid, methotrexate or hydroxychloroquine for chronic inflammatory arthritis with CPPD. Asymptomatic CPPD requires no treatment. Strength of recommendations varies from 79\% to 95\%.
CONCLUSION: Nine key recommendations for management of CPP crystal associated arthritis were developed using both research evidence and expert consensus. Strength of recommendations was provided to assist the application of these recommendations.},

	abstract = {Objective To produce European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the reporting of ultrasound studies in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs).
Methods Based on the literature reviews and expert opinion (through Delphi surveys), a taskforce of 23 members (12 experts in ultrasound in RMDs, 9 in methodology and biostatistics together with a patient research partner and a health professional in rheumatology) developed a checklist of items to be reported in every RMD study using ultrasound. This checklist was further refined by involving a panel of 79 external experts (musculoskeletal imaging experts, methodologists, journal editors), who evaluated its comprehensibility, feasibility and comprehensiveness. Agreement on each proposed item was assessed with an 11-point Likert scale, grading from 0 (total disagreement) to 10 (full agreement).
Results Two face-to-face meetings, as well as two Delphi rounds of voting, resulted in a final checklist of 23 items, including a glossary of terminology. Twenty-one of these were considered ‘mandatory’ items to be reported in every study (such as blinding, development of scoring systems, definition of target pathologies) and 2 ‘optional’ to be reported only if applicable, such as possible confounding factors (ie, ambient conditions) or experience of the sonographers.
Conclusion An EULAR taskforce developed a checklist to ensure transparent and comprehensive reporting of aspects concerning research and procedures that need to be presented in studies using ultrasound in RMDs. This checklist, if widely adopted by authors and editors, will greatly improve the interpretability of study development and results, including the assessment of validity, generalisability and applicability.},

	abstract = {Objectives To develop a consensus-based ultrasound (US) definition and quantification system for synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Methods A multistep, iterative approach was used to: (1) evaluate the baseline agreement on defining and scoring synovitis according to the usual practice of different sonographers, using both grey-scale (GS) (synovial hypertrophy (SH) and effusion) and power Doppler (PD), by reading static images and scanning patients with RA and (2) evaluate the influence of both the definition and acquisition technique on reliability followed by a Delphi exercise to obtain consensus definitions for synovitis, elementary components and scoring system.
Results Baseline reliability was highly variable but better for static than dynamic images that were directly acquired and immediately scored. Using static images, intrareader and inter-reader reliability for scoring PD were excellent for both binary and semiquantitative (SQ) grading but GS showed greater variability for both scoring systems (κ ranges: −0.05 to 1 and 0.59 to 0.92, respectively). In patient-based exercise, both intraobserver and interobserver reliability were variable and the mean κ coefficients did not reach 0.50 for any of the components. The second step resulted in refinement of the preliminary Outcome Measures in Rheumatology synovitis definition by including the presence of both hypoechoic SH and PD signal and the development of a SQ severity score, depending on both the amount of PD and the volume and appearance of SH.
Conclusion A multistep consensus-based process has produced a standardised US definition and quantification system for RA synovitis including combined and individual SH and PD components. Further evaluation is required to understand its performance before application in clinical trials.},
